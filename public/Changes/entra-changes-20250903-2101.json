    "Response": "This commit refines the documentation for checking workflow execution scope in Microsoft Entra ID. The changes clarify that the displayed list of users under the execution scope includes all users who currently meet the conditions, irrespective of whether they have already been processed by the workflow. A note has also been updated to provide further context on potential delays in the accuracy of the displayed results following recent changes.",

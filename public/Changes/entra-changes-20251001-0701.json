This change is actively rolling out to all tenants in production by end of October. \\\\n+\\\\n+**What’s New**\\\\n+\\\\n+- **SMS Authentication for Password Reset:** End users can now verify their identity via SMS when using the *“forgot password”* or self-service password reset flow. Previously, only email one-time passcodes were supported.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Enhanced Security:** If users have two or more registered methods for password reset, they'll now be required to verify their identity with at least two methods, adding an extra layer of protection.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Fraud Protection:** With built-in integration to the Phone Reputation platform, telephony activity is processed in real time to identify risks. Each request is returned with an Allow, Block, or Challenge decision to help protect against telephony fraud.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Billing:** SMS for password reset is a part of add-on feature with tiered pricing based on location/region. Charges per SMS include the fraud protection services. For more information, see:  [SMS pricing tiers by country/region](../external-id/customers/concept-multifactor-authentication-customers.md#sms-pricing-tiers-by-countryregion).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Microsoft Security Copilot Access Review Agent in Microsoft Entra\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Access Reviews        \\\\n+**Product capability:** Identity Governance    \\\\n+\\\\n+Say goodbye to time-consuming research and the uncertainty of rushed decisions. With the public preview of the [Microsoft Security Copilot Access Review Agent in Microsoft Entra](https://aka.ms/ARAgent), we’re bringing the power of AI directly into the heart of access governance.\\\\n+\\\\n+The agent works for your reviewers by automatically gathering insights and generating recommendations to help them make fast, accurate access decisions.

This new application will manifest as a first party service principal called the \\\\\\\"Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service\\\\\\\" (Application ID: 6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016) and will be visible in the Enterprise Applications experience within the Microsoft Entra admin center. This application is critical for the continued operation of on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID synchronization functionality through Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Connect now uses this first party application to synchronize between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Customers are required to upgrade to version **2.5.79.0** or later by **September 2026**. \\\\n+\\\\n+We'll auto-upgrade customers where supported. For customers who wish to be auto-upgraded, [ensure that you have auto-upgrade configured](../identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md).  \\\\n+\\\\n+The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change is exclusively available on Microsoft Entra admin center under [Microsoft Entra Connect](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/~/GetStarted).\\\\n+\\\\n+Check our [version history page](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history.md) for more details on available versions.\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - App management policies portal experience\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Enterprise Apps    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Directory    \\\\n+\\\\n+App management policies allow administrators to improve the security of their organization by setting rules on how applications in their organization can be configured. They can use them to block insecure configurations like password credentials. These policies have been available through the Microsoft Graph API, but can now also be configured using the Microsoft Entra admin center, under the Enterprise applications experience.\\\\n+\\\\n+Learn more about [how to configure app management policies](https://aka.ms/app-mgmt-policy-ux-docs).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Delegate approvals in My Access\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Entitlement Management    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Entitlement Management    \\\\n+\\\\n+Users can now delegate their access package approvals in My Access. Approvers can assign another individual to respond to access package approval requests on their behalf. The original approvers can still respond to their approvals during the delegation period.  \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> This feature currently applies only to access package approvals and will be expanded to support access reviews in November 2025.  \\\\n+  \\\\n+For more information, see: [Delegate approvals in My Access](../id-governance/delegate-approvals-my-access.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Reprocess failed users and workflows in Lifecycle Workflows\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Lifecycle Workflows    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Identity Governance    \\\\n+\\\\n+Lifecycle Workflows now supports reprocessing of your workflows to help organizations streamline the reprocessing of workflows when errors or failures are discovered.

After detecting inactivity, the workflow automatically executes predefined tasks—such as sending inactivity notifications, disabling accounts, or initiating offboarding—for users that exceed the inactivity threshold. Admins can configure the inactivity threshold and scope, ensuring dormant accounts are handled efficiently and consistently - reducing security exposure, reducing license waste, and enforcing governance policies at scale.\\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see: [Manage inactive users using Lifecycle Workflows (Preview)](../id-governance/lifecycle-workflow-inactive-users.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Retirement - Microsoft Authentication Library to MSAL Recommendations API\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** Deprecated    \\\\n+**Service category:** Other    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Developer Experience    \\\\n+\\\\n+We’re retiring the **ADAL to MSAL Recommendations API** on **December 15, 2025**.\\\\n+\\\\n+To continue monitoring authentication library usage, customers can query sign-in logs manually via **Microsoft Graph API**.

Existing apps already configured with this feature continues to work, but it will no longer be available for new configurations. Going forward, admins should use the “*Capture sign-in fields for an app*”. This requires the MyApps Secure Sign-In Extension, available for Microsoft Edge and Chrome. \\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see: [Capture sign-in fields for an app](../identity/enterprise-apps/troubleshoot-password-based-sso.md#capture-sign-in-fields-for-an-app) \\\\n+\\\\n+To learn about our passwordless strategy, see:[Passwordless is here and at scale](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/passwordless-is-here-and-at-scale/2810639).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Global Secure Access Internet profile support for iOS client\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Internet Access    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Network Access    \\\\n+\\\\n+We're excited to announce the Internet Access support with iOS app. This feature protects access to internet and SaaS apps with an identity-based Secure Web Gateway (SWG), blocking threats, unsafe content, and malicious traffic from the iPhones and iPads.\\\\n+\\\\n+Global Secure Access client on mobile platforms requires no new agent installation/deployment for secure access to their resources, and uses existing MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) to route traffic through Microsoft SSE for both Microsoft 365, internet access and private access.\\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see: [Global Secure Access client for iOS (Preview)](../global-secure-access/how-to-install-ios-client.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Basic HTML support in Lifecycle Workflow custom email notifications\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Lifecycle Workflows    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Identity Governance    \\\\n+\\\\n+Now customers can further customize their Lifecycle workflows email notifications to personalize, or emphasize, specific information using basic HTML elements.

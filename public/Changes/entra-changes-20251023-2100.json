      "Response": "This commit updates the documentation on recovering from deletions in Microsoft Entra ID. It clarifies that application objects with specific `signInAudience` values (e.g., `AzureADMultipleOrgs`) are not automatically hard-deleted after 30 days and require manual deletion. This change aims to provide users with more precise information regarding application object lifecycle management.",

      "Response": "This commit modifies the documentation on recovering from deletions. The primary change is the reformatting of a note regarding the automatic hard deletion of application objects. Previously, the note was presented with a standard bulleted list, but it has now been converted to a `[!Note]` block, enhancing its visual prominence. Additionally, a minor grammatical correction was made to the sentence structure within the note.",

    "Response": "These commits primarily focus on updating documentation within Microsoft's Entra ID documentation. Key changes include:\n\n*   **Date updates:** A minor update to the publication date of the \"Deployment external operations\" article.\n*   **Role permission clarification:** The documentation for the \"Conditional Access Optimization Agent\" has been clarified to specify the necessary administrator roles (Global Administrator and Conditional Access Administrator AND Global Reader) for identifying Intune app protection policies.\n*   **Tooling documentation enhancements:** The `Remove-ADSyncToolsAadObject` and `Remove-ADSyncToolsAadPublicFolders` cmdlets documentation has been updated with important notes. These include warnings about the irreversibility of deletions for non-user objects, the requirement for Global Administrator credentials (without MFA support), and the temporary re-enabling of DirSync if it's disabled on the tenant.",

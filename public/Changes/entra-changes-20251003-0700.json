Guests can see groups they're members of in both the Azure portal and the My Apps portal depending on permissions:<ul><li>**Default permissions**: To find the groups they're members of in the Azure portal, the guest must search for their object ID in the **All users** list, and then select **Groups**. Here they can see the list of groups that they're members of, including all the group details, including name, email, and so on. In the My Apps portal, they can see a list of groups they own and groups they're in.</li><li>**Restricted guest permissions**: In the Azure portal, they can find the list of groups they're in by searching for their object ID in the **All users** list, and then selecting **Groups**. They can see only limited details about the group, notably the object ID. By design, the Name and Email columns are blank and Group Type is Unrecognized. In the My Apps portal, they're not able to access the list of groups they own or groups they're a member of.</li></ul><br>For more detailed comparison of the directory permissions that come from the Graph API, see [Default user permissions](~/fundamentals/users-default-permissions.md#member-and-guest-users).\\\\n-Which parts of the My Apps portal will this feature affect? | The groups functionality in the My Apps portal honors these new permissions. This functionality includes all paths to view the groups list and group memberships in My Apps. No changes were made to the group tile availability. The group tile availability is still controlled by the existing group setting in the Azure portal.\\\\n-Do these permissions override SharePoint or Microsoft Teams guest settings? | No. Those existing settings still control the experience and access in those applications. For example, if you see issues in SharePoint, double check your external sharing settings. Guests added by team owners at the team level have access to channel meeting chat only for standard channels, excluding any private and shared channels.\\\\n-What are the known compatibility issues in  Yammer? | With permissions set to \\\\\\\"restricted\\\\\\\", guests signed into Yammer aren't able to leave the group.\\\\n-Will my existing guest permissions be changed in my tenant? | No changes were made to your current settings.

    "Response": "This commit updates the documentation for searching groups, members, and owners in Microsoft Entra ID.\n\nThe changes include:\n\n*   A clarification that the \"contains\" search for groups uses tokenized matching rather than literal substring matching, providing a brief explanation of how tokenization works.\n*   An update to the description of searching group members and owners, stating that a tokenized \"contains\" search is automatically used.\n*   Minor changes to metadata, such as the `ms.date` and `ms.reviewer` fields.",

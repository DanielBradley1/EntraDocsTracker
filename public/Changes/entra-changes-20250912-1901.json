    "Response": "This commit modifies a Markdown document detailing the setup for uniFLOW Online provisioning. The changes involve slightly rephrasing sentences to clarify that both users *and/or* groups can be provisioned, and that the scope setting applies to these users and groups. The primary goal is to enhance the clarity of the provisioning configuration instructions.",

Key changes include the addition of a new feature to manage inactive users, a new trigger based on sign-in activity, and enhancements to email customization within workflows. Furthermore, the documentation has been updated to reflect new workflow templates related to inactive users and adjustments to the device identity key storage process for Apple devices, alongside minor corrections in API examples and permission references.",

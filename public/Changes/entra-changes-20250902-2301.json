      "Response": "The changes update the documentation for installing the Global Secure Access client on Android and iOS devices. For Android, the article has been restructured to focus on deploying the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app via Intune and configuring Global Secure Access through app configuration policies. It also includes new screenshots for the configuration process. For iOS, minor wording adjustments have been made to improve clarity. Both articles have also had their `ms.date` and `ms.reviewer` fields updated.",

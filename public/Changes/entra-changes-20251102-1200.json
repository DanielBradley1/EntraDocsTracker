current “*Revoke multifactor authentication sessions*” button with the “*Revoke sessions*” button in the MicrosoftEntra portal.\\\\n+\\\\n+The legacy “*Revoke MFA session*s” action only applies to per-user MFA enforcement, which has led to confusion. To simplify and ensure consistent behavior, the new “*Revoke sessions*” button will invalidate all user sessions, including MFA, regardless of whether MFA is enforced via Conditional Access or per-user policies.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Action required**\\\\n+\\\\n+Admins should update workflows and guidance to use “*Revoke sessions*” instead of “*Revoke MFA sessions*”.

    "Response": "A new document, `id-protection-guide-analyze.md`, has been added, detailing how to master risk analysis for effective remediation using Microsoft Entra ID Protection and Azure Monitor Logs. This includes guidance on tracking risk events, discerning risk types, and examining risk levels.\n\nThe existing documents `id-protection-guide-detect.md`, `id-protection-guide-introduction.md`, `id-protection-guide-investigate.md`, and `id-protection-guide-remediate.md` have been updated to include a link to the new analysis guide, enhancing the overall structure and discoverability of the Microsoft Entra ID Protection proof-of-concept guidance series.\n\nAdditionally, several image files have been added to support the new `id-protection-guide-analyze.md` document, and the `toc.yml` file has been updated to reflect the inclusion of the new article. The `whats-new.md` document has also been updated with an announcement regarding a change to the MFA session revocation functionality.",

Including best practices, scenarios, and considerations of transferring source of authority to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+author: OWinfreyATL\\\\n+ms.author: owinfrey\\\\n+ms.reviewer: dhanyak\\\\n+ms.date: 09/17/2025\\\\n+ms.topic: concept-article\\\\n+ms.service: entra-id\\\\n+ms.subservice: hybrid\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+#customer intent: As an IT Architect, I want to learn best practices for beginning the process to transfer SOA and become cloud-first within my environment.\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Cloud-First identity management: Guidance for IT architects\\\\n+\\\\n+Modern enterprises are under increasing pressure to improve security by modernizing identity management and streamlining operations. This document provides a strategic and technical framework for IT architects to shift user and group management from on-premises Active Directory (AD) to Microsoft Entra ID using Source of Authority (SOA) conversion. A legacy AD environment can be complex, costly to maintain, and if not kept up to date, increasingly vulnerable to modern threats. Microsoft's goal is to provide options to secure hybrid customers by allowing them to establish Microsoft Entra ID for identity management. Transferring SOA enables a phased, low-risk migration path—avoiding the disruption of a “big bang” cutover.\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide provides IT architects with a comprehensive overview of cloud-first identity management. It explains the business and security benefits of moving to cloud-based identity, outlines a phased roadmap for transitioning from hybrid environments to cloud-first and AD-minimized states, and describes how to assess readiness for SOA transfer of users and groups. This guide also details an app-centric approach for organizations not yet ready to fully shift, covers integration strategies for Kerberos and LDAP-based applications, highlights key limitations and considerations for hybrid coexistence, and offers a practical checklist to support planning, execution, and governance throughout the migration process.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Business and Security Benefits\\\\n+\\\\n+Active Directory has long been considered the “**keys to the kingdom**” for organizations, making it an attractive target for attackers if compromised. Reducing reliance on AD, by migrating application authentication to use Microsoft Entra ID, improves security with users protected by Conditional Access and MFA. Migrating identities and authentication to Microsoft Entra ID also unlocks modern capabilities such as Conditional Access policies, password-less authentication, and advanced identity governance for users and applications, including those originally managed on-premises. In essence, centralizing management in Microsoft Entra ID strengthens an organization’s overall security posture.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Enhance IT efficiency and user experience\\\\n+\\\\n+A cloud-first approach can help enhance IT efficiency and user experience in your organization in the following ways:\\\\n+\\\\n+- IT administrators can manage user identities, groups, and federated or provisioned application access policies through Microsoft Entra ID’s admin center and Microsoft Graph APIs.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID governance features such as Entitlement Management, Access Reviews, and Lifecycle Workflows streamline governance for apps relying on groups formerly managed in AD. This introduces automation, which helps compliance throughout the identity lifecycle.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Users benefit from **single sign-on** across both cloud, and on-premises, applications using modern access controls such as risk-based conditional access policies. After migration, employees can use their Microsoft Entra ID credentials, such as phishing-resistant password-less methods, to seamlessly access legacy intranet applications. This reduces the need to manage multiple AD passwords and mitigates credential sprawl.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Roadmap to Cloud Identity: Hybrid to Cloud-First/AD minimized state\\\\n+\\\\n+Organizations typically advance through distinct stages on the “*road to the cloud*,” beginning with a **hybrid** approach that consists of using both cloud and on-premises AD within their environment. This is followed by the [cloud-first](../../architecture/road-to-the-cloud-posture.md#state-3-cloud-first) stage, where resources are increasingly shifted to the cloud. The next stage organizations achieve is the [AD-minimized](../../architecture/road-to-the-cloud-posture.md#state-4-active-directory-minimized) state. SOA transfer of users, groups, and contacts facilitates this journey by allowing incremental migration of identities to Microsoft Entra ID. Rather than decommissioning AD all at once, which would necessitate rewriting or re-platforming numerous applications, SOA enables a *phased approach*. With this approach, organizations can migrate suitable identities to the cloud immediately, and gradually reduce their AD footprint over time.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Always begin with an application inventory before initiating SOA transfer. This helps you maintain access for users tied to legacy AD apps.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Scenarios you can unlock\\\\n+\\\\n+### Minimize AD footprint for users and groups no longer needed in AD\\\\n+\\\\n+After you transition to cloud services and modern applications, certain AD accounts and groups might become obsolete. Today these users and groups are still created in AD through traditional identity management solutions such as MIM. This is done because manually creating these objects in the cloud is an intensive manual effort. When you begin deciding for whom you want to transfer SOA, you can decide to remove AD out of the picture for these users and groups. This allows you to remove them from both AD and Microsoft Entra, or if they're only needed in Microsoft Entra, they can have their SOA transferred before being [removed from AD alone](how-to-active-directory-group-cleanup.md). This targeted transition allows organizations to automate the migration, and monitor its progress while minimizing operational disruption. For more information, see: [Minimizing AD Users and Govern user lifecycle with Microsoft Entra ID Governance](user-source-of-authority-overview.md#minimizing-ad-users-and-governing-user-lifecycle-with-microsoft-entra-id-governance).\\\\n+\\\\n+### Shifting lifecycle management to the cloud\\\\n+\\\\n+You can use Microsoft Entra ID Governance to enable lifecycle and access governance of SOA transferred users and groups from the cloud. For Users, this means you're now provisioning the users directly into Microsoft Entra ID and can use Microsoft Entra's ID Governance capabilities to govern these users. For groups, you can modernize your groups and enable access governance of apps tied to them from the cloud. Some caveats apply here where groups that are Exchange constructs like Mail-Enabled Security Groups (MESGs) and Distribution Lists (DLs), require modernization before being managed in the cloud. Refer to [Group SOA guidance for more info](../../identity/hybrid/concept-source-of-authority-overview.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Is SOA the right solution for you?\\\\n+\\\\n+The following diagram outlines if you're ready to transfer the source of authority (SOA) of users and groups:\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/guidance-it-architects-source-of-authority/source-of-authority-readiness-diagram.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Diagram of steps to see if you are ready to transfer source of authority for user and groups.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/guidance-it-architects-source-of-authority/source-of-authority-readiness-diagram.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+### Considerations\\\\n+\\\\n+**Users:** SOA is suitable for users who don't have any application dependencies linked to AD DS. Identifying which users are associated with specific applications is crucial for effective migration planning. \\\\n+\\\\n+**Groups:** For groups, we recommend you start with shifting security groups to the cloud. Once in the cloud, provision them back to AD from Microsoft Entra ID if needed. For Distribution Lists (DLs) and Mail-Enabled Security Groups (MESGs), our recommendation is to shift them once all your Exchange workloads is in the cloud, and you no longer need an On-premises Exchange server.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Application-Centric Approach: Modernize on-premises authentication\\\\n+\\\\n+This section outlines a principal cloud migration strategy for AD-heavy environments called the application-centric approach. This approach enables on-premises applications to utilize Microsoft Entra ID for identity. This section also includes detailed steps, prerequisites, and guidance for addressing challenges like legacy application password synchronization. The application-centric approach works for customers who are far into their password-less journey. For apps that require password, currently, there’s no path to shift users to the cloud.\\\\n+\\\\n+The application-centric approach tackles cloud migration from the perspective of your applications. In this approach, you try to modernize your app authentication by applying the following framework:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Inventory Applications:** List all on-premises apps that use AD for authentication (Kerberos/NTLM or LDAP).\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Integration Goal:** Reconfigure each app to use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, reducing reliance on on-premises AD.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Bridging Solutions:** Use Microsoft Entra Application Proxy, Microsoft Entra Domain Services, or other cloud services to connect legacy apps to Microsoft Entra ID without major rewrites.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Recommended sequence for application-centric migration\\\\n+\\\\n+There can also be some apps already using modern protocols like SAML/OIDC via Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) or third-party IdPs. These apps are easier to migrate directly to Microsoft Entra, while some other legacy cases like hardcoded NTLM-only apps, might need special handling.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Application inventory and authentication analysis\\\\n+\\\\n+It’s critical to **discover and categorize all on-premises applications** before planning the migration. The goal is to determine for each app: *How does it currently authenticate users*, and *what is the best path to integrate or modernize that authentication with Microsoft Entra ID?*\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/guidance-it-architects-source-of-authority/application-inventory.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Checklist of what needs to be considered as far as application owners, and telemetry, before transferring source of authority.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+A thorough application analysis forms the foundation for a successful migration to cloud-based identity management in AD-heavy environments. This process involves methodically assessing every application that depends on Active Directory for authentication, determining how each authenticates users, and mapping a modernization or integration plan that fits each application's unique requirements. The following steps are the recommended sequence for an app centric migration:\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 1. Cataloging Active Directory–Integrated applications\\\\n+\\\\n+Start your migration by identifying all applications that use AD for authentication or authorization. Understand their dependencies to plan a move to cloud identity management, noting which AD groups and user accounts connect with each application. This helps prioritize which users and groups transition first, particularly those linked to business-critical apps.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Discover Active Directory–Integrated applications\\\\n+\\\\n+Use tools like [Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access Application Discovery](../../global-secure-access/how-to-application-discovery.md) and AD Domain Controller logs to determine what apps employees are accessing, and how those apps interact with AD. Prioritize high-usage applications using dashboards that sort by user count and filter by individual user activity.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Map applications to AD Security Groups\\\\n+\\\\n+For every app found, identify the AD security groups that control its access. Collaborate with owners, or review configurations, to list these groups. Use scripts or AD queries when necessary to locate relevant groups, especially if group names or descriptions reference the app. For more information on identifying security groups, see: [Clean up unused Active Directory Domain Services groups in a single domain](how-to-active-directory-group-cleanup.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Identify users for each application\\\\n+\\\\n+Determine users by extracting group memberships for each application's AD groups and analyzing actual usage data. Combine membership lists and usage logs to create a definitive list of users for each app. Use this information to guide cloud migration planning, ensuring access is maintained throughout the process.\\\\n+\\\\n+###  Step 2. Determine authentication method\\\\n+\\\\n+For each application in your inventory, identify the authentication mechanism it uses. This step is essential for choosing the most appropriate migration, or integration, strategy. The main categories to consider include:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Integrated Windows Authentication (Kerberos/NTLM)** – Common in IIS/.NET applications using Windows Authentication, file servers, SharePoint, and similar platforms. These typically allow users to sign in with domain credentials, often without a separate prompt.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **LDAP Authentication/Queries** – Applications can have LDAP server settings pointing to AD and perform binds or lookups, custom-developed or third-party products prompting users for AD credentials.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Federation/Modern Authentication** – Some applications are already federated via AD FS, or support modern protocols such as SAML or OAuth. These can generally be reconfigured to use Microsoft Entra ID with minimal effort.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Other Legacy Methods** – Includes cases where apps use RADIUS against AD or local accounts. Though not the primary focus, these should be documented for completeness.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 3. Assess modernization feasibility\\\\n+\\\\n+Evaluate each application's ability to adopt modern authentication protocols (SAML/OIDC) natively. If a vendor update is available, or if the app was developed in-house and can be re-coded, transitioning to Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider is typically the best long-term solution. This approach removes AD dependency and unlocks the full benefits of cloud identity management. However, for older applications that can't be easily updated, plan for a \\\\\\\"*bridge*\\\\\\\" solution to integrate them with Microsoft Entra ID, even if indirect integration is required.\\\\n+\\\\n+Some older applications might have hard-coded assumptions about AD such as expecting to find a user in a specific OU, or writing attributes to AD. Those apps are **out of scope** for this kind of identity migration. These applications aren't easily supported by Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft Entra Domain Services unless you keep write permissions there, which is possible, but then you have divergent data. Make sure to identify if any app does LDAP writes or depends on obscure AD features such as dynamic auxiliary classes. Those might have to remain on AD until they’re retired. The focus should be on apps that *read/authenticate* via AD as those can be moved to cloud auth as described.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 4. Categorize applications and plan integration approach\\\\n+\\\\n+After you determine authentication methods and modernization feasibility, group applications into distinct categories to guide your integration plan:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Minimize number of Apps that you need to manage:** For apps that are in plans to be sunset with a target date, these can be considered out of scope and any management of users/groups tied to these apps can be shifted to the cloud. For apps that are redundant, consolidate the app and determine if it can be modernized or not.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Apps already using or capable of modern auth:** These can be migrated directly to Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider, such as updating AD FS applications to point to Microsoft Entra ID or moving files to Azure file shares. While not the central focus, addressing these reduces overall legacy dependency. Any management of users/groups tied to these apps is in scope to be transferred to the cloud.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Kerberos/NTLM Apps (not easily modernized):** Use Microsoft Entra as a front-end through Application Proxy or similar solutions. The application remains on-premises, but user authentication switches to Microsoft Entra ID tokens, which are translated into Kerberos tickets within AD.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **LDAP-Binding Apps:** Introduce a managed AD instance in Azure, specifically Microsoft Entra Domain Services, allowing these apps to bind to a cloud-managed AD instead of the on-premises environment.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Other Special Cases:** For applications that can't be altered or proxied, such as older client-server apps limited to AD joined machines, consider hosting them on VDI solutions like Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365 Cloud PC, or others. This maintains a managed environment for these apps while enabling cloud migration elsewhere. This should be a last resort due to added complexity and cost.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Disconnected apps:** For apps that have business requirements of working without internet connections or work in a disconnected environment, you need to stay on-premises. Users using these apps aren't eligible to transfer SOA.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 5. Mapping and planning\\\\n+\\\\n+By concluding the analysis phase, you should have a clear mapping of which applications fall into the \\\\\\\"*Kerberos category*,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"*LDAP category*,\\\\\\\" or other buckets, along with the specific integration mechanism each will require. This planning step is vital as each application has unique characteristics that must be carefully considered before selecting a migration strategy. Microsoft Entra ID fortunately offers solutions for most AD-based authentication patterns, and even legacy applications that can't be modified can benefit from secure hybrid access and modern governance.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 6. Migrate groups to the cloud\\\\n+\\\\n+In an app-centric approach, it's best to migrate security groups and app access controls to the cloud first. This enables centralized access management, and ensures group memberships remain intact before moving users. Microsoft recommends transferring group's SOA ahead of users to maintain membership integrity and allow testing. You can also adjust the sequence for each app, such as piloting an application with its groups, and test users end-to-end. When shifting to the cloud, we have outlined specific guidance on how you can map them to cloud groups as outlined in [Guidance for using Group Source of Authority (SOA) in Microsoft Entra ID (Preview)](../../identity/hybrid/concept-group-source-of-authority-guidance.md) or watch the following video:\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpRDtulXcUw]\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!TIP]\\\\n+> Migrate security groups to the cloud first. This allows you to test app access controls before moving user\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 7. Handling LDAP-based applications (Directory-Bound Apps)\\\\n+\\\\n+**LDAP-bound applications** or services directly query Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) via LDAP, most often for authentication using a simple bind with username and password, or for directory reads. Common examples include older enterprise applications, network appliances, or custom-developed apps that rely on LDAP binds to validate credentials. These applications typically require an LDAP server, and can't easily transition to modern authentication protocols.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Recommended Solution: Microsoft Entra Domain Services\\\\n+\\\\n+The recommended solution for supporting LDAP-bound apps in the cloud is Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Hosted on Azure, Microsoft Entra Domain Services provides LDAP, Kerberos, and NTLM endpoints, syncing user accounts, and credentials from your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. This allows legacy applications to use cloud-hosted AD for authentication without switching\\\\n+to modern protocols. The managed domain mainly supports read and authentication for LDAP clients.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 8. Handling Kerberos-Based Applications (Windows Integrated Auth)\\\\n+\\\\n+**Kerberos-based apps** typically encompass internal web applications using Windows Authentication, file servers (SMB) that rely on Kerberos tickets, and other services where Active Directory (AD) sign in is required. Microsoft offers intermediary solutions to integrate these applications with Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Microsoft Entra Application Proxy or Private Access with Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD):**\\\\n+\\\\n+*Recommended solution:*\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Microsoft Entra Application Proxy or Private Access with Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD):** This cloud service enables the publication of an on-premises web application through Microsoft Entra ID. Users authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, such as using OAuth/OpenID Connect, and the Application Proxy connector operating on-premises obtains a Kerberos ticket to the backend application on the user’s behalf using KCD. Microsoft Entra ID serves as the authentication gateway, translating authentication to Kerberos for the application. This solution supports web-based applications (HTTP/HTTPS) and can provide single sign-on (SSO) for cloud-managed users *provided those users have an account in AD*.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Passwordless with Cloud Kerberos Trust:** This method lets Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n+issue Kerberos tickets for on-premises AD resources when users sign in with Microsoft Entra ID credentials using password-less authentication such as Windows Hello for Business and FIDO2. It requires configuring the AD domain to trust Microsoft Entra ID’s cloud Kerberos service and ensuring users’ AD objects have the necessary keys. The process is fully password-less, making it ideal for cloud users to access on-premises resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Key Considerations Before Migrating Kerberos Workloads\\\\n+\\\\n+The following are key considerations for Kerberos applications before shifting  user and group workloads associated with these apps:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **User lifecycle management:** Even after you transition a user to cloud management, an AD account with matching UserPrincipalName must remain for Kerberos functionality.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Authentication and Attributes:** Don't migrate users who require access to applications that rely on passwords to authenticate, and can't be updated to use Kerberos authentication. Applications that can support Kerberos authentication and query attributes from Active Directory require those attributes to be in sync, potentially using a dual-write to Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Microsoft Entra ID joined devices:** For true single sign-on, devices accessing Kerberos resources should be Microsoft Entra ID-joined or hybrid-joined. When a user logs into a device using Microsoft Entra ID credentials, the device can obtain a token from Microsoft Entra ID that's convertible to a Kerberos ticket via trust or connector. If a device is only domain-joined, and the user is cloud-managed, seamless SSO can be difficult, possibly requiring manual credential entry. Microsoft recommends migrating devices to Microsoft Entra ID join with cloud trust as part of cloud transformation so that user and device trust are aligned. \\\\n+\\\\n+    > [!NOTE]\\\\n+    > Device migration is outside the current scope for transferring SOA.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Conditional Access for on-prem apps:** Once App Proxy or Microsoft Entra Private Access is deployed for an application, Conditional Access policies such as MFA can be enforced on application access since authentication passes through Microsoft Entra ID. This enhances security as even legacy apps benefit from Zero Trust conditions without modification. For Kerberos trust scenarios, Conditional Access applies when the user initially authenticates to Microsoft Entra ID on the device.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 9. Verify and optimize\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+Test each integrated application thoroughly. Ensure that existing AD-sourced users can access the application via the new method. Verify that group memberships from Microsoft Entra ID are honored via group provisioning to AD. Monitor performance and sign in logs. Optimize any settings for production use.\\\\n+\\\\n+Ensure that all users whose source of authority was transferred are able to still access the application. Ensure that group memberships that were present in AD is also present in Microsoft Entra ID. Verify using [Group logs](how-to-source-of-authority-auditing-monitoring.md) and [User logs](user-source-of-authority-audit-monitor.md) that source of authority was successfully transferred.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Conclusion\\\\n+\\\\n+The following list is a summary of the options for handling on-premises apps in a cloud-first model:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Kerberos-based Apps** (Windows Integrated Authentication, intranet web apps, file shares)\\\\n+  - **Cloud Integration Method & Tools:**\\\\n+    - Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy with Kerberos (KCD): Publish on-premises web apps through Microsoft Entra ID and use a connector for Kerberos on-premises.\\\\n+    - Microsoft Entra ID Cloud Kerberos Trust: For Microsoft Entra ID joined devices (for example, non-web file shares).\\\\n+  - **Requirements:**\\\\n+    - Microsoft Entra Private Access installed on-premises\\\\n+    - Configured SPN and delegation rights\\\\n+    - Microsoft Entra ID P1/P2 or Suite licenses\\\\n+    - AD account for user (synced or provisioned)\\\\n+  - **Considerations:**\\\\n+    - Seamless SSO using Microsoft Entra ID credentials\\\\n+    - Password-less and phish-resistant methods for Kerberos apps\\\\n+    - Secure access to on-premises resources\\\\n+\\\\n+- **LDAP-based Apps** (Apps that bind to AD DS over LDAP for auth/queries)\\\\n+  - **Cloud Integration Method & Tools:**\\\\n+    - Microsoft Entra ID Domain Services (Managed AD): Cloud-hosted AD domain synced with Microsoft Entra ID; repoint app’s LDAP connection to this domain (LDAPS).\\\\n+  - **Requirements:**\\\\n+    - Set up Microsoft Entra ID DS instance in Azure\\\\n+    - Configure virtual network, secure LDAP cert, firewall rules\\\\n+    - Users/groups must be in Microsoft Entra ID (synced to Microsoft Entra ID DS)\\\\n+    - Might require password reset to generate hashes\\\\n+  - **Considerations:**\\\\n+    - Minimal app changes (new LDAP endpoint)\\\\n+    - Cloud users’ passwords present in Microsoft Entra ID DS\\\\n+    - If Microsoft Entra ID DS isn't feasible, fallback is provisioning users into on-premises AD and maintaining password parity manually.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## SOA Transfer Checklist for IT Architects\\\\n+\\\\n+### Understand Strategic Benefits\\\\n+\\\\n+- Reduce security risks by minimizing on-premises AD dependency.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Enable modern identity features (Conditional Access, password-less,\\\\n+  Zero Trust).\\\\n+\\\\n+- Streamline identity management and governance in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Assess Readiness\\\\n+\\\\n+- Inventory all users, groups, and applications.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Identify users/groups no longer tied to AD-dependent apps.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Map authentication dependencies for each application (Kerberos, LDAP,\\\\n+  SAML/OIDC).\\\\n+\\\\n+### Choose the Right Approach\\\\n+\\\\n+- User-centric: Only for users not tied to password-based AD apps.\\\\n+\\\\n+- App-centric: Required if any apps still use AD for authentication\\\\n+  (recommended).\\\\n+\\\\n+### Plan Group Migration\\\\n+\\\\n+- Shift security groups to the cloud; provision back to AD from Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n+  if needed.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Shift DLs and MESGs only after Exchange workloads are fully\\\\n+  cloud-based.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Modernize Application Authentication\\\\n+\\\\n+- For Kerberos/NTLM apps:  \\\\n+  [Cloud Kerberos Trust](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/deploy/hybrid-cloud-kerberos-trust)\\\\n+\\\\n+- For LDAP apps:  \\\\n+  [LDAP Overview](/entra/architecture/auth-ldap)\\\\n+\\\\n+- For modern/federated apps:  \\\\n+  Reconfigure to authenticate directly against Microsoft Entra ID (SAML/OIDC).\\\\n+\\\\n+### Enable Password-less Authentication\\\\n+\\\\n+- Deploy [Hello For Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business)\\\\n+\\\\n+- Integrate with [cloud kerberos trust](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/deploy/hybrid-cloud-kerberos-trust) for seamless ticket-based authentication.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Implement Entra ID Governance\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Lifecycle Workflows in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/id-governance/what-are-lifecycle-workflows)\\\\n+- [Entitlement Management Overview](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-overview)\\\\n+- [Access Reviews Overview](/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview)\\\\n+- [Privileged Identity Management for Resource Roles](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)\\\\n+\\\\n+### Address Key Limitations\\\\n+\\\\n+- No password writeback for cloud-only users.

environment for user SOA (Preview)\\\\n+\\\\n+Once you decide that you want to minimize your on-premises footprint by using Source of Authority for users, you must prepare your Active Directory environment based on how users are configured. How you choose to prepare your environment is based on many factors. For other things to consider, see: [Prerequisites for Transferring User SOA](user-source-of-authority-overview.md#prerequisites-for-transferring-user-soa) and [Guidance for using User Source of Authority (SOA) (Preview)](user-source-of-authority-guidance.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+The flow for preparing for user SOA is as follows:\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment/prepare-source-of-authority-overview.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of steps to prepare for source of authority.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+This article walks you through what needs to be completed to prepare Microsoft Exchange, HR integration, and Microsoft Identity Manager environments before switching user SOA.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Confirm your AD objects are ready to have their SOA changed \\\\n+\\\\n+Before transferring the SOA of users, retrieve the objects from your Active Directory domain and check that they’re ready to be transferred by confirming the following information:\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+- Confirm that the objects are already synchronized to Microsoft Entra. Administrative objects, or objects excluded from synchronization, can’t have their SOA changed. \\\\n+- Confirm that all attributes you have, or plan to modify, on those users are being synched to Microsoft Entra and are visible as either directory attributes, or as *directory schema extensions*: `/graph/api/resources/extensionproperty` in Microsoft Graph. \\\\n+- Confirm there are no reference-valued attributes populated on those user objects in Active Directory other than the user's manager's attribute, and Active Directory backlinks such as `memberof`. Other reference-valued attributes aren't supported for SOA transfer.\\\\n+- Confirm that the value of the manager and member attributes, if set, must be references to users in the same Active Directory domain and that they're synchronized to Microsoft Entra. They can’t refer to other object types, or to objects that aren’t synchronized from this domain to Microsoft Entra. \\\\n+- Confirm that there are no attributes on the objects that are updated by another Microsoft on-premises technology, other than Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) itself. For example, don’t change the SOA of a user whose `userCertificate` attribute is maintained by [Active Directory Certificate Services](/windows-server/identity/ad-cs/active-directory-certificate-services-overview). \\\\n+\\\\n+## Update Active Directory\\\\n+\\\\n+If you’re planning to only change the SOA for some Active Directory users, and all your users are currently in a single OU using Kerberos applications that don’t use LDAP, we recommend that you create a new AD DS OU for these objects. Having them in a separate OU will enable you to avoid inadvertently making updates to them in Active Directory after the SOA change. Users, whose SOA isn’t changing, can continue to be managed using Active Directory Users and Computers, Active Directory Module for PowerShell, or other Active Directory management tools. After creating an OU, move the objects to that OU. For more information, see: [Move-ADObject](/powershell/module/activedirectory/move-adobject?view=windowsserver2025-ps).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prepare your Microsoft Exchange setup\\\\n+\\\\n+In case you have Exchange Hybrid setup with Microsoft 365 Exchange Online, prepare your Exchange Server and Exchange Online as per the following guidance before switching the SOA of your user accounts.\\\\n+If you're running an Exchange Hybrid configuration, ensure all your mailboxes are migrated to Exchange Online before you switch the SOA for any users to the cloud. After mailbox migration of all users, these users can be managed in Microsoft 365, and you can safely switch SOA of users to cloud. With SOA switched, you disable Exchange Hybrid by completing following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tPoint the MX and Autodiscover DNS records to Exchange Online instead of Exchange Server. \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tRemove the Service Connection Point (SCP) values on Exchange servers. This step ensures that no SCPs are returned, and the Outlook clients use the DNS method for Autodiscover.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\t(Optional) To secure your environment, remove the inbound and outbound connectors created by the Hybrid Configuration Wizard used for mail flow between Exchange Server and Exchange online.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\t(Optional) To secure your environment, remove the organization relationship, Fed Trust, and oauth trust set up between Exchange Server and Exchange Online by HCW.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tStop writing to on-premises Exchange for the object and sync the object to cloud to ensure EXO has the latest changes from on-premises.\\\\n+\\\\n+For more information on disabling Exchange Hybrid, see: see: [Manage recipients in Exchange Hybrid environments using Management tools](/Exchange/manage-hybrid-exchange-recipients-with-management-tools).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Shift the configuration of users in provisioning from the HR system\\\\n+\\\\n+The next step in setting up SOA is to determine your provisioning strategy for your HR system. In the pre-SOA world, users from your HR system are first provisioned in on-premises Active Directory and then synced to Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Connect Sync or Cloud Sync. If you’re using Microsoft Entra provisioning service, you have most likely configured one of the following apps: Workday to AD user provisioning, SAP SuccessFactors to AD user provisioning or API-driven provisioning to AD. The following diagram depicts the data flow in this configuration. \\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment/before-conversion.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of HR system before transferring source of authority.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+To update this configuration, first identify employees from your HR system who can be provisioned into Microsoft Entra ID directly, and are no longer needed in Active Directory. You can take a phased approach to identify such employees using grouping constructs available in HR, for example: transferring SOA of users by department, cost center, or location. Then update your Microsoft Entra provisioning configuration as described in the following section:\\\\n+\\\\n+### Update your HR provisioning configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+Once you identify the employees for SOA conversion, follow these steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Create a new provisioning application in Microsoft Entra ID to provision users from your HR system directly to Microsoft Entra ID. Use scoping filters to restrict this app to only handle SOA converted users. For example: In the first phase, if you’re transferring SOA only for users in the “*Finance*” department, then set the scoping filter as department EQUALS “*Finance*.” Expand the scoping filter in future phases to include more users.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tUpdate the configuration of your HR to Active Directory provisioning app to exclude the SOA transferred users from syncing to AD. Continuing with the previous example, you can exclude *“Finance”* department users from syncing to AD by setting the filter department to NOT EQUALS “*Finance*.” \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tUpdate the configuration of your Microsoft Entra Connect Sync / Cloud Sync app to exclude the SOA transferred users from syncing to Microsoft Entra ID using a similar scoping filter. \\\\n+\\\\n+The following diagram depicts the new SOA-aware provisioning configuration:\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment/after-conversion.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of HR system source of authority after conversion.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prepare your MIM setup \\\\n+\\\\n+For customers using Microsoft Identity Manager(MIM), you can update the sync rules in MIM to determine which objects continue to be provisioned into Active Directory, and which ones are provisioned into Microsoft Entra ID.  \\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment/prepare-identity-setup.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of MIM Set up for SOA.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+To prepare your MIM setup for user SOA, do the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tSelect the attributes that will be the unique identifiers for users that are the same in both Active Directory and Microsoft Entra. \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tAdd the [Microsoft Identity Manager connector for Microsoft Graph](/microsoft-identity-manager/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-graph) to MIM sync, configure a join of the existing Active Directory users brought in from this connector.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tCheck the precedence settings on the user. \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tPerform a full import from Microsoft Entra using the Microsoft Graph connector.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tConfirm that all the users planned for the SOA conversion are joined between the metaverse and the Microsoft Graph connector.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tUpdate the management system for those users (for example, MIM Portal and Service) to add a label to user objects for which the SOA is changing to Microsoft Entra ID. \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tUpdate the sync rules so that you’re no longer syncing those labeled user objects from MIM to Active Directory, but instead synching to the Microsoft Graph connector.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tKeep the sync rules deactivated until the SOA transfer is complete.   \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tAfter the SOA transfer, resync users. Confirm there are no exports pending to the AD MA for users whose SOA changed, only to the Microsoft Graph connector.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tAdd to your run profile schedules a run of exporting changes from MIM to Microsoft Entra ID using the Microsoft Graph connector.   \\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tIf you’re no longer exporting any changes to other users in Active Directory, then remove the export to AD run profile from your run profile schedules. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+Once these steps are completed, your MIM-synced hybrid environment should follow this diagram:\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment/identity-ready-for-source-of-authority.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of a diagram of an environment that's ready to use user SOA.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Sequence of steps for using SOA\\\\n+\\\\n+Once your environment is prepped for transferring user SOA, the sequence for transferring SOA is as follows:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.\\\\tIdentify the users and/or groups for whom you’re going to Switch the source of authority (SOA) to Microsoft Entra ID.

This article provides guidance on using user Source of Authority (SOA) to help transition users from on-premises to the cloud. How to minimize your Active Directory (AD) footprint after SOA transfer, adopt best practices for transitioning user management, and ensure a smooth migration of user management to the cloud are also covered in this article. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Active Directory user management\\\\n+\\\\n+One of the key scenarios for transferring SOA for users, is the ability to minimize your AD footprint. Once you complete the SOA transfer, users who no longer require access to Active Directory-specific resources can be disabled within AD, or deleted completely. \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> If users still require access to on-premises resources after SOA transfer, then these attributes must be maintained manually using Microsoft Graph. For more information on these attributes, see: [Clear on-premises attributes for SOA transferred users](how-to-user-source-of-authority-configure.md#clear-on-premises-attributes-for-soa-transferred-users)\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Best practices\\\\n+\\\\n+Follow these best practices to transition user management from on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Move users to an OU\\\\n+\\\\n+Using Active Directory management tools like Active Directory Users and Computers or the Active Directory module for PowerShell to modify AD objects with a changed Source of Authority (SOA) can lead to inconsistencies in their Microsoft Entra representation. Before you perform a SOA change, your organization should move those objects to a designated AD OU that signals that those objects should no longer be managed via AD tools. If the user who’s SOA you want to transfer is referenced in an on-premises managed group, then the user should remain in the sync scope. If you delete the on-premises user, then it's also removed from both the on-premises and Microsoft Entra group.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Transition user management\\\\n+\\\\n+Before shifting the SOA of users, ensure the sync cycle of the users is complete. Once complete, remove the users from the scope of the HR to AD, or MIM to AD configuration, and add them to your HR->Microsoft Entra ID configuration. If your organization uses Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) with the Active Directory Management Agent (AD MA) to manage AD users and groups, you must update the sync logic to stop exporting changes to those objects via AD MA before making an SOA change. Instead of using the AD MA, you can have MIM update the objects in Microsoft Entra using the [MIM connector for Microsoft Graph](/microsoft-identity-manager/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-graph) so that the changes made by MIM are first sent to Microsoft Entra, and then to Active Directory where needed. For more information, see: [Prepare your MIM setup](prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment.md#prepare-your-mim-setup). Stop making any changes directly to the user in AD. Once SOA is complete, begin management of users within the cloud.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Users using LDAP applications\\\\n+\\\\n+If you want to shift users using on-premises LDAP applications to the cloud, use [Microsoft Entra Domain services](../../identity/domain-services/overview.md) to shift the LDAP application to the cloud before transferring the SOA of users.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Third-party federated authentication\\\\n+\\\\n+If your organization uses a third-party federation authentication identity provider and plans to transfer the SOA of users, you must manage the Active Directory account manually and maintain the password using the third-party sync tool. If users are using federated authentication using [Active Directory Federation Service](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview), then transferring SOA isn't supported.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Devices\\\\n+\\\\n+We recommend that customers migrate their devices to the cloud, and use a Microsoft Entra Joined Device setup in order to fully use user SOA capabilities.

For the road to the cloud initiative, Microsoft has [modeled five states of transformation](/entra/architecture/road-to-the-cloud-posture#five-states-of-transformation) to align with customer business goals. Transitioning the Source of Authority (SOA) for users from on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to the cloud is a key step in this journey. This process, known as AD DS minimization, reduces the complexity of on-premises infrastructure by managing users directly in the cloud.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article introduces the concept of user SOA, its benefits, and the scenario it supports. It also outlines key considerations and prerequisites for IT administrators planning to shift user management to the cloud using Microsoft Entra ID. By using user SOA, organizations can streamline user lifecycle management, enable advanced governance capabilities, and fully embrace a cloud-first posture.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## User SOA scenario\\\\n+ \\\\n+The next sections explain more details about the scenario that User SOA supports.\\\\n+ \\\\n+### Minimizing AD users and governing user lifecycle with Microsoft Entra ID Governance\\\\n+ \\\\n+**Scenario**: You modernized some or all your applications and removed the need to use AD DS users for access. For example, these applications now use user [claims with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](../../identity-platform/saml-claims-customization.md) or [OpenID Connect](../../identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc.md) from Microsoft Entra ID instead of federation systems such as AD FS. However, these apps still rely on the existing synched user to manage access. By implementing User SOA, you can edit the user in the cloud, remove the AD DS user completely, and govern the user through Microsoft Entra ID Governance capabilities.\\\\n+ \\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/user-source-of-authority-overview/user-source-of-authority-minimization.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of user SOA minimization.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+ \\\\n+### Password-less authentication of SOA transferred users\\\\n+ \\\\n+**Scenario**:  You’ve transferred the SOA for users and now want to allow them to access both on-premises, and cloud, resources. Instead of completely removing users from on-premises, introduce Cloud Kerberos Trust password-less authentication to allow them to maintain a hybrid presence allowing them to continue to access their on-premises resources, while also allowing them to access cloud resources. Password-less authentication methods, such as [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/configure) or [FIDO2 security keys](../../identity/authentication/how-to-enable-passkey-fido2.md), can be used to allow these users to access both their on-premises resources, and cloud resources such as [Azure Files](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) through [Microsoft Entra Private Access](../../global-secure-access/concept-private-access.md). Using Password-less authentication also enables Multifactor Authentication on the SOA transferred users increasing security. Password-less authentication also allows you to enable Conditional Access policies on the on-premises resources, allowing greater control and security over these resources.\\\\n+ \\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/user-source-of-authority-overview/passwordless-authentication-source-of-authority.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the password-less authentication scenario for User SOA.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites for transferring user SOA\\\\n+\\\\n+Before you begin transferring the SOA for users in your organization, your environment must meet the following prerequisites:\\\\n+\\\\n+- The Cloud HR system has been configured and successfully integrated with Microsoft Entra ID. Changes to users provisioned from the HR system should go directly Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see: [Shift the configuration of users in provisioning from the HR system](prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment.md#shift-the-configuration-of-users-in-provisioning-from-the-hr-system).\\\\n+- No on-premises Exchange workloads. If you're currently using on-premises Exchange server, shift the users and mailboxes to the cloud and then remove on-prem-exchange. For more information, see: [Prepare your Microsoft Exchange setup](prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment.md#prepare-your-microsoft-exchange-setup).\\\\n+- Password-less authentication utilizing [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/configure) or [FIDO2 security keys](../../identity/authentication/how-to-enable-passkey-fido2.md) is required.\\\\n+- The [Cloud Kerberos Trust type](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/deploy/hybrid-cloud-kerberos-trust) must be utilized.\\\\n+- The users intended for SOA transfer aren't associated with any applications that require password-based authentication. If any of the users you want to transfer SOA for have any password dependencies, then transferring SOA isn't supported. If users are using federated authentication using [Active Directory Federation Service](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview), then transferring SOA isn't supported. If your organization uses a third-party federation authentication identity provider, and plan to transfer the SOA of users, you must manage the Active Directory account manually. With this process, you must maintain the password using the third-party sync tool.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Related content\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Configure User Source of Authority (SOA) in Microsoft Entra ID (Preview)](how-to-user-source-of-authority-configure.md)\\\\n+- [Prepare Your Environment for User SOA (Preview)](prepare-user-source-of-authority-environment.md)\\\"\\r\\n  }\\r\\n].

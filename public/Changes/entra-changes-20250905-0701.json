Using an account that doesn't have standing permissions can cause authentication failures for the agent.\\\\n+- Once agents are started, they can't be stopped or paused. It might take a few minutes to run.\\\\n+- The agent runs using the identity of the administrator who activated it for the first time to gather insights and save recommendations. Final decisions, as part of the Microsoft Teams conversation, is written with the reviewer’s identity.\\\\n+- We recommend running the agent from the Microsoft Entra admin center.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Supported Scenarios\\\\n+The following tables show current Access Review Agent support based on review scenarios:\\\\n+\\\\n+| Scenario |Supported  |\\\\n+|---------|---------|\\\\n+|**Resources**  |  |\\\\n+|Teams + Groups     |   :white_check_mark:       |\\\\n+|Access package assignment     |    :white_check_mark:      |\\\\n+|Application assignment        |   :white_check_mark:       |\\\\n+|Azure resource roles          |    ❌                        |\\\\n+|Microsoft Entra roles         |   ❌                         |\\\\n+|Groups managed by Privileged Identity Management         |   ❌                         |\\\\n+|**Size**  |  |\\\\n+|Up to 35 decisions (per review, not reviewer)     |  :white_check_mark:       |\\\\n+|>35 decisions per review     |   ❌       |\\\\n+|**Stages**  |  |\\\\n+|Single Stage     |  :white_check_mark:       |\\\\n+|Multi-stage     |   ❌       |\\\\n+|**Reviewers**  |  |\\\\n+|Specific     |   :white_check_mark:       |\\\\n+|Group owners     |  :white_check_mark:        |\\\\n+|Managers     |  :white_check_mark:        |\\\\n+|Self-reviews     |  ❌    |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How it works\\\\n+The Access Review Agent proactively scans for active access reviews in your tenant that are flagged for processing by the agent. The agent then analyzes identified reviews by gathering extra insights, and generates a recommendation (approve / deny) and a justification summary for each decision. Once the agent analyzes the recommendations and corresponding justification summaries, it's able to guide reviewers, in natural language, through the review process in Microsoft Teams. Reviewers are empowered to complete their reviews through the natural language chat experience in Microsoft Teams. As the agent guides them through the review, they're able to review the agent's reasoning behind the recommendations, ask questions in the context of the review itself, and finally make their own informed decision.\\\\n+\\\\n+The agents recommendation (approve / deny) for each decision relies on a deterministic scoring mechanism powered by multiple signals. The signals used for the recommendation are then used to provide an end-user friendly justification summary powered by a large language model (LLM). The subsequent natural language chat experience in Microsoft Teams is facilitated by the large language model with previously generated recommendations and justification summaries as available context.\\\\n+\\\\n+The agent considers the following signals:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **User inactivity**: If the user has [signed in](review-recommendations-access-reviews.md#inactive-user-recommendations)\\\\n+- **User-to-Group affiliation**: If the user has a [low affiliation](review-recommendations-access-reviews.md#user-to-group-affiliation) with other users who have this access\\\\n+- **Account enabled**: If the user's account is enabled (accountEnabled property)\\\\n+- **Employment status**: If the user's employment ended ([employeeLeaveDateTime property](/graph/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows-set-employeeleavedatetime))\\\\n+- **Lifecycle workflow history**: If the user has had a mover workflow ran for them in the past 30 days\\\\n+- **Decisions from previous reviews**: For recurring reviews, decisions from previous review iterations are considered\\\\n+- **Access request history**: For access package assignment reviews, the request and approval history is considered\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> The justification summary includes information from these signals and is available to the reviewer during the review process even though some of this information isn't available to reviewers outside of the review process.\\\\n+\\\\n+As an admin you're able to review the recommendations (approve / deny) and justification summaries. For details see, [Access Review Agent logs and metrics (Preview)](access-review-agent-logs-metrics.md). Note the agent recommendations can differ from the recommendations shown on the My Access portal and Access Review experience in the Microsoft Entra admin center.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Getting started\\\\n+### Setting up the Access Review Agent\\\\n+1. With an account that has at least **all** the following roles, sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com):\\\\n+   - [Identity Governance  Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator)\\\\n+   - [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator)\\\\n+   - [Security Copilot Contributor](/copilot/security/authentication#assign-security-copilot-access)\\\\n+1. From the new home page, select **Go to agents** from the agent notification card.\\\\n+   - You can also select **Agents** from the left navigation menu.\\\\n+   :::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/access-review-agent/start-access-review-agent.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of starting the Access Review Agent.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/access-review-agent/start-access-review-agent.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+1. Select **View details** on the Access Review Agent tile.\\\\n+    \\\\n+1. Select **Start agent** to begin your first run. \\\\n+   - Avoid using an account with a role activated through PIM.\\\\n+   - A message that says \\\\\\\"*The agent is starting its first run*\\\\\\\" appears in the upper-right corner.\\\\n+   - The first run might take a few minutes to complete.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Enable the access review agent for existing access reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+After the Access Review Agent is started, you must flag access reviews to be processed by the Access Review Agent. The Access Review Agent is able to process both new, and existing, access reviews. The following sections walk you through flagging access review to be processed by the Access Review Agent.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Enable the access review agent for existing group and application access reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+To update an existing access review to be processed by the Access Review Agent, perform the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Access reviews**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select the access review you want the agent to support.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the access review overview page, select **Settings** under Manage if it's a one time review, or **Settings** under Series if it's a recurring review.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Advanced Settings**, check the box on the setting that says **Access Review Agent (Preview)**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Save**. \\\\n+\\\\n+#### Enable the Access Review Agent for existing access package assignment reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+To update an existing access review to be processed by the Access Review Agent, perform the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Entitlement management** > **Access package**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select the access package you want the agent to support.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the access package overview page, select **Policies**, then select the policy you want to update and select **Edit**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the edit policy page, select **Lifecycle**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the lifecycle tab, select Advanced Access Review settings and check the **Enable** box on the setting that says **Access Review Agent (Preview)**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Save**.    \\\\n+\\\\n+### Ensure reviewers can use the Access Review Agent\\\\n+\\\\n+Reviewers access the Access Review Agent through a [Microsoft Teams App](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3). If your organizations' [Microsoft Teams org-wide app settings](/microsoftteams/manage-apps#manage-org-wide-app-settings) allow Microsoft applications no action is required. If your organization has disabled Microsoft apps in the Microsoft Teams org-wide app settings your organizations' Microsoft Teams administrator must explicitly approve the app.\\\\n+\\\\n+You must also ensure that all reviewers have at least the [Security Copilot Contributor](/copilot/security/authentication#assign-security-copilot-access) role so that they can use the agent to complete their reviews. This is required because the natural language conversation in Microsoft Teams is opening a Microsoft Security Copilot session behind the scenes. Participating reviewers access the agentic experience via Microsoft Teams, but with the role assignment they'll be entitled to access the [Security Copilot portal](https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com/) or the Security Copilot experience in other Microsoft Security administrative portals. If reviewers access Security Copilot outside of Microsoft Teams, their data access with Security Copilot is still subject to [default user permissions](../fundamentals/users-default-permissions.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Using the Access Review Agent as a reviewer\\\\n+\\\\n+With the Access Review Agent started, reviewers assigned proper permissions, and with the app available to them, your reviewers are now ready to complete their reviews with the help of the agent.

with a feature called access reviews. This article covers how a designated reviewer performs an access review for members of a group or users with access to an application. If you want to review access to an access package, read [Review access of an access package in entitlement management](entitlement-management-access-reviews-review-access.md).\\\\n \\\\n-## Perform access review by using My Access\\\\n-You can review access to groups and applications via My Access. My Access is a user-friendly portal for granting, approving, and reviewing access needs.\\\\n+You can review access to groups and applications via the [My Access portal](https://myaccess.microsoft.com/) or via chat with the [Access Review Agent (Preview)](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3) in Microsoft Teams. The Access Review Agent is currently in preview and does not yet support all types of group and application reviews, if the agent cannot yet help you with your assigned reviews it will guide you to the My Access portal.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Perform an access review using the Access Review Agent (Preview)\\\\n+The Access Review Agent assists you in completing your pending access reviews by guiding you in Microsoft Teams with natural language, insights, and recommendations.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Go directly to the Access Review Agent\\\\n+1. Select the [Access Review Agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3) link to open the agent\\\\n+1. Select **Add** or **Open** to access the conversation with the Access Review Agent\\\\n+1. Prompt the agent with **Help me with my access reviews** and the agent will assist you in completing your pending access reviews.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Use email to go to the Access Review Agent\\\\n+\\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> There could be delays in receiving email. In some cases, it could take up to 24 hours. Add MSSecurity-noreply@microsoft.com to your safe recipients list to make sure that you're receiving all emails.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Look for an email from Microsoft asking you to review access.\\\\n+1. Select the **Start review** link to open the [Access Review Agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3). The **Start review** link will either open the Access Review Agent or the My Access portal based on your organizations policies. If the link opens the My Access portal the Access Review Agent has not been enabled for the specific review and must be completed via the My Access portal.\\\\n+1.

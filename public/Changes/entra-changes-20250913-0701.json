    "Response": "This commit introduces a comprehensive restructuring of the Microsoft Entra security documentation. The core `configure-security.md` file has been significantly revised, moving from a pillar-based approach to a more organised grouping of security recommendations. This change is accompanied by the creation of six new markdown files, each dedicated to a specific Zero Trust security pillar (Protect identities and secrets, Protect tenants and isolate production systems, Protect networks, Protect engineering systems, Monitor and detect cyberthreats, and Accelerate response and remediation), providing detailed guidance within each area. Additionally, the table of contents for the fundamentals section has been updated to reflect these changes, and a redirection has been added for the 'What If' tool documentation. Some minor updates have also been made to the Conditional Access documentation, including date changes and clarifying wording.",

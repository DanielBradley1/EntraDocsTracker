      "Response": "This commit refactors the \"Deploy Conditional Access policies\" section of the documentation. It reorganises the policy deployment into three distinct phases â€“ Foundation, Core Authentication, and Advanced Protection â€“ with recommended timelines. Each phase now includes specific policy recommendations, prerequisites, and license requirements, aiming to guide users through a more structured and less disruptive implementation process. The changes also introduce a crucial \"Before deploying any policy\" checklist to ensure better preparedness and minimise user impact.",

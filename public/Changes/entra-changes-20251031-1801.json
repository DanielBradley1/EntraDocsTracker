Maintaining the same underlying object ensures the user’s account and access to resources isn’t disrupted and that their history of activities remains intact as their relationship with the host organization changes. \\\\n+\\\\n+The external to internal user conversion feature includes the ability to convert on-premises synchronized users as well.\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### General Availability - Granular, Least-Privileged Permissions for UserAuthenticationMethod APIs\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** MS Graph    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Developer Experience    \\\\n+\\\\n+**Summary**\\\\n+\\\\n+We're introducing new, granular permissions for the UserAuthenticationMethod APIs in Microsoft Entra ID. This update enables organizations to apply the principle of least privilege when managing authentication methods, supporting both security and operational efficiency.\\\\n+\\\\n+**What’s New?**\\\\n+\\\\n+- **New per-method permissions:** Fine-grained permissions for each authentication method (for example, Password, Microsoft Authenticator, Phone, Email, Temporary Access Pass, Passkey, Windows Hello for Business, QR+PIN, and others).\\\\n+- **Read-only policy permission:** A new permission allows read-only access to authentication method policies, improving role separation and auditability.\\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn](/graph/permissions-reference)\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Cloud Managed Remote Mailboxes\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** User Management    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync    \\\\n+\\\\n+The Source of Authority (SOA) at the object level allows administrators to convert specific users synced from Active Directory (AD) to Microsoft Entra ID into cloud-editable objects, which are no longer synced from AD and act as if originally created in the cloud. This feature supports a gradual migration process, decreasing dependencies on AD while aiming to minimize user and operational impact. Both Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Cloud Sync recognize the SOA switch for these objects. The option to switch the SOA of synced users from AD to Microsoft Entra ID is currently available in Public Preview. For more information, see: [Embrace cloud-first posture: Transfer user Source of Authority (SOA) to the cloud (Preview)](../identity/hybrid/user-source-of-authority-overview.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Prefetch Workday termination data to customize account disable logic\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** Fixed    \\\\n+**Service category:** Provisioning    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Inbound to Microsoft Entra ID    \\\\n+\\\\n+This Workday connector update resolves termination processing delays observed for workers in APAC and ANZ regions. Admins can now enable termination lookahead setting to prefetch data and tailor deprovisioning logic for accounts in Microsoft Entra ID and on-premises Active Directory. For more information, see: [Configure Workday termination lookahead (Preview)](../identity/app-provisioning/configure-workday-termination-lookahead.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### General Availability - Ability to convert Source of Authority of synced on-premises AD groups to cloud groups is now available \\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Group Management    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync    \\\\n+\\\\n+The Group SOA feature lets organizations move application access governance from on-premises to the cloud by transferring Active Directory group authority to Microsoft Entra ID using Connect Sync or Cloud Sync. With phased migration, admins can reduce AD dependencies gradually and minimize disruption. Microsoft Entra ID Governance manages access for both cloud and on-premises apps linked to security groups, and customers of either sync client can now use this feature. For more information, see: [Group source of authority](https://aka.ms/groupsoadocs).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Plan for Change - Jailbreak Detection in Authenticator App\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** Plan for change    \\\\n+**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    \\\\n+\\\\n+**Starting February 2026**, we'll introduce **Jailbreak/Root detection for Microsoft Entra credentials in the Authenticator app**. This update strengthens security by preventing Microsoft Entra credentials from functioning on jail-broken or rooted devices. All existing credentials on such devices will be wiped to protect your organization.\\\\n+\\\\n+This capability is secure by default and requires no admin configuration or control. The change applies to both iOS and Android.This change won't apply to personal or third party accounts.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Action required:** Notify end users about this upcoming change.

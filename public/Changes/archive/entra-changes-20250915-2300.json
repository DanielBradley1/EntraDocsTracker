      "Response": "The changes include updates to documentation regarding tenant restrictions, specifically addressing limitations with macOS Platform SSO and issues accessing the Microsoft Entra admin center. Additionally, documentation has been enhanced to include Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access scenarios within the Security Copilot documentation, detailing how to investigate network traffic logs. Furthermore, adjustments have been made to clarify advanced options for passkeys (FIDO2) and certificate-based authentication in Conditional Access policies, including updated terminology and troubleshooting guidance. Finally, improvements have been made to the documentation on analyzing Conditional Access policy impact, emphasizing the use of report-only mode, Azure Monitor, and insights workbooks.",

Traffic forwarding profiles can be assigned to devices and remote networks. For an example of how to apply a Conditional Access policy to these traffic profiles, see the article [How to apply Conditional Access policies to the Microsoft 365 traffic profile](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-target-resource-microsoft-365-profile).\\\\n \\\\n For more information about these profiles, see the article [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](/entra/global-secure-access/concept-traffic-forwarding).\\\\n \\\\n ## User actions\\\\n \\\\n User actions are tasks that a user performs. Conditional Access supports two user actions:\\\\n \\\\n-- **Register security information**: This user action allows Conditional Access policy to enforce when users who are enabled for combined registration attempt to register their security information. Learn more in [Combined security information registration](~/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).\\\\n+- **Register security information**: This user action lets Conditional Access policies enforce rules when users try to register their security information. For more information, see [Combined security information registration](~/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).\\\\n \\\\n > [!NOTE]\\\\n-> When administrators apply a policy targeting user actions for registering security information, if the user account is a guest from [Microsoft personal account (MSA)](~/external-id/microsoft-account.md), using the control 'Require multifactor authentication' requires the MSA user to register security information with the organization. If the guest user is from another provider such as [Google](~/external-id/google-federation.md), access is blocked.\\\\n+> If admins apply a policy targeting user actions for registering security information and the user account is a guest from a [Microsoft personal account (MSA)](~/external-id/microsoft-account.md), the 'Require multifactor authentication' control requires the MSA user to register security information with the organization. If the guest user is from another provider such as [Google](~/external-id/google-federation.md), access is blocked.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Register or join devices**: This user action enables administrators to enforce Conditional Access policy when users [register](~/identity/devices/concept-device-registration.md) or [join](~/identity/devices/concept-directory-join.md) devices to Microsoft Entra ID. It provides granularity in configuring multifactor authentication for registering or joining devices instead of a tenant-wide policy that currently exists. There are three key considerations with this user action:\\\\n+- **Register or join devices**: This user action enables admins to enforce Conditional Access policy when users [register](~/identity/devices/concept-device-registration.md) or [join](~/identity/devices/concept-directory-join.md) devices to Microsoft Entra ID. It lets admins configure multifactor authentication for registering or joining devices with more granularity than a tenant-wide policy. There are three key considerations with this user action:\\\\n    - `Require multifactor authentication` and `Require auth strength` are the only access controls available with this user action and all others are disabled. This restriction prevents conflicts with access controls that are either dependent on Microsoft Entra device registration or not applicable to Microsoft Entra device registration.\\\\n-       - Windows Hello for Business and device-bound passkeys aren't supported, as those scenarios require the device is already registered.\\\\n+       - Windows Hello for Business and device-bound passkeys aren't supported because those scenarios require the device to be already registered.\\\\n    - `Client apps`, `Filters for devices`, and `Device state` conditions aren't available with this user action because they're dependent on Microsoft Entra device registration to enforce Conditional Access policies.\\\\n \\\\n > [!WARNING]\\\\n-> When a Conditional Access policy is configured with the **Register or join devices** user action, you must set **Entra ID** > **Devices** > **Overview** > **Device Settings** - `Require Multifactor Authentication to register or join devices with Microsoft Entra` to **No**. Otherwise, Conditional Access policies with this user action aren't properly enforced.

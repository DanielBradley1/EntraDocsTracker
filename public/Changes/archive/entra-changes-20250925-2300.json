They're simple to deploy and maintain, and powerful. This article explains what connectors are, how they work, and how to optimize your deployment.\\\\n \\\\n ## What is a private network connector?\\\\n \\\\n-Connectors are lightweight agents that sit in a private network and facilitate the outbound connection to the Microsoft Entra Private Access and application proxy services. Connectors must be installed on a Windows Server that has access to the backend resources. You can organize connectors into connector groups, with each group handling traffic to specific resources. For more information on application proxy and a diagrammatic representation of application proxy architecture, see [Using Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md).\\\\n+Private network connectors are lightweight agents you install on a Windows Server inside your network. They create outbound connections to Microsoft Entra Private Access and the application proxy service to reach backend resources. Organize connectors into connector groups that handle traffic for specific resources. For an architecture overview, see [Using Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md). To set them up, see [How to configure private network connectors for Microsoft Entra Private Access](how-to-configure-connectors.md). Users connect to the cloud service, which routes traffic to apps through the connectors.\\\\n \\\\n+Set up and register a connector with the application proxy service:\\\\n+1. Open outbound ports 80 and 443 and allow access to the required service and Microsoft Entra ID URLs.\\\\n+1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center and run the installer on an on-premises Windows Server.\\\\n+1. Start the connector so it listens to the application proxy service.\\\\n+1. Add the on-premises application to Microsoft Entra ID and set the user-facing URLs.\\\\n \\\\n-To learn how to configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector, see [How to configure private network connectors for Microsoft Entra Private Access](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Private network connectors are lightweight agents deployed on-premises that facilitate the outbound connection to the application proxy service in the cloud. The connectors must be installed on a Windows Server that has access to the backend application. Users connect to the application proxy cloud service that routes their traffic to the apps via the connectors.\\\\n-\\\\n-Setup and registration between a connector and the application proxy service is accomplished as follows:\\\\n-\\\\n-1. The IT administrator opens ports 80 and 443 to outbound traffic and allows access to several URLs that are needed by the connector, the application proxy service, and Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n-2. The admin signs into the Microsoft Entra admin center and runs an executable to install the connector on an on-premises Windows server.\\\\n-3. The connector starts to \\\\\\\"listen\\\\\\\" to the application proxy service.\\\\n-4. The admin adds the on-premises application to Microsoft Entra ID and configures settings such as the URLs users need to connect to their apps.\\\\n-\\\\n-It's recommended that you always deploy multiple connectors for redundancy and scale. The connectors, in conjunction with the service, take care of all the high availability tasks and can be added or removed dynamically. Each time a new request arrives it's routed to one of the connectors that is available. When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. If a connector is temporarily unavailable, it doesn't respond to this traffic. Unused connectors are tagged as inactive and removed after 10 days of inactivity.\\\\n+Deploy at least two connectors for redundancy and scale. The service and connectors handle high availability, and you can add or remove connectors at any time. Each request routes to an available connector. If a connector is unavailable, it doesn't handle traffic. The service tags unused connectors as inactive and removes them after 10 days of inactivity.\\\\n \\\\n > [!NOTE]\\\\n > You can monitor the [version history page](reference-version-history.md) to stay informed on the latest updates so that you can schedule appropriate connector upgrades.\\\\n \\\\n-Each private network connector is assigned to a [connector group](concept-connector-groups.md). Connectors in the same connector group act as a single unit for high availability and load balancing. You can create new groups, assign connectors to them in the Microsoft Entra admin center, then assign specific connectors to serve specific applications. It's recommended to have at least two connectors in each connector group for high availability.\\\\n+Each private network connector belongs to a [connector group](concept-connector-groups.md).

The service routes new requests to an available connector. If a connector is temporarily unavailable, it doesn't receive traffic.\\\\n \\\\n-The connectors are stateless and have no configuration data on the machine. The only data they store is the settings for connecting the service and its authentication certificate. When they connect to the service, they pull all the required configuration data and refresh it every couple of minutes.\\\\n+Connectors are stateless and store no configuration data on the machine. They store only the settings for connecting to the service and the authentication certificate. When they connect to the service, they pull the required configuration data and refresh it every few minutes.\\\\n \\\\n-Connectors also poll the server to find out whether there's a newer version of the connector. If one is found, the connectors update themselves.\\\\n+Connectors poll the service for updates. When a newer version is available, they update themselves.\\\\n \\\\n-You can monitor your connectors from the machine they're running on, using either the event log and performance counters. You can also view their status in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For Microsoft Entra Private Access, navigate to Global Secure Access, Connect, and select Connectors. For application proxy, navigate to Identity, Applications, Enterprise applications, and select the application. On the application page select application proxy.\\\\n+Monitor connectors on the host machine by using the event log and performance counters. View status in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. Unused connectors are tagged as `_inactive_` and are removed after 10 days of inactivity. If you do want to uninstall a connector, though, uninstall both the Connector service and the Updater service from the server. Restart the computer to fully remove the service.\\\\n+You don't need to delete unused connectors manually. The service tags inactive connectors `_inactive_` and removes them after 10 days.

If your CPU or memory utilization is above the suggested maximum, you may want to consider adding more connectors to distribute your workloads effectively. \\\\n+Keep peak CPU and memory utilization per connector under 70%. If sustained utilization exceeds 70%, add connectors to the group or scale up host capacity to distribute load. Monitor with Windows performance counters to validate that utilization returns to an acceptable range.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Throughput:** \\\\n-Each connector, configured with the above specifications, can support up to 1.5 Gbps throughput over TCP on an Azure VM. Throughput is measured as the total of both inbound and outbound traffic. Higher throughput can be achieved by running the connector on VMs with increased memory, CPU resources, and enhanced network link speeds.\\\\n+Up to ~1.5 Gbps aggregate TCP throughput (combined inbound + outbound) per connector on an Azure VM sized at 4 vCPU / 8 GiB RAM with standard networking. Higher throughput can be achieved by using larger VM sizes (more vCPUs, memory, accelerated/high-bandwidth NICs) or by adding more connectors in the same group to scale out.\\\\n \\\\n-**Additional Details:**  \\\\n-- Sizing recommendations made above are based on performance testing done on a test tenant using iPerf3 tool with TCP data streams. Actual performance can vary under different testing environments. More details on specific test cases will be published as part of this documentation in coming months. \\\\n+**More details:**  \\\\n+- Performance guidance (for example ~1.5 Gbps on a 4 vCPU / 8 GiB host) is derived from controlled lab tests using iPerf3 TCP data streams in a dedicated test tenant. Actual throughput can vary based on CPU generation, NIC capabilities (accelerated networking, offloads), TLS cipher suites, network latency and jitter, packet loss, concurrent protocol mix (HTTP(S), SMB, RDP), intermediate devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS, SSL inspection), and backend application responsiveness. Scenario-based benchmark data (mixed workloads, high-connection concurrency, latency-sensitive applications) will be added to this documentation as it becomes available.\\\\n - Once a connector is enrolled, it establishes outbound TLS tunnels to the Private Access cloud infrastructure. These tunnels handle all data path traffic. In addition, we have some control plane channel, driving keep-alive heartbeat, health reporting, connector upgrades and so on utilizing minimal bandwidth.\\\\n-- You can deploy additional connectors within the same connector group to increase overall throughput, provided adequate network and internet connectivity is available. It is recommended to maintain a minimum of two healthy connectors to ensure resiliency and consistent availability.

    "Response": "This commit updates the documentation for the access review agent. It clarifies the consumption of Security Compute Units (SCUs) per access review, changing the average from one SCU to 4.5 SCU for twenty decisions. This adjustment accounts for the agent's insight gathering, recommendation generation, and the reviewer's conversational interaction.",

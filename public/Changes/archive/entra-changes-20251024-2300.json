This system enables the infrastructure authentication within an Azure region to be resilient to issues that might occur in another region or within the larger Microsoft Entra service. This system complements Azure's cross-region architecture. Building your own applications using MI and following Azure's [best practices for resilience and availability]() ensures your applications are highly resilient. In addition to MI, this regionally resilient backup system protects key Azure infrastructure and services that keep the cloud functional.\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"1f515e2c7cda22a140b665a5e4f09f22febbc0fe\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/app-provisioning/configure-workday-termination-lookahead.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 155,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 155,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/573236f1560ce2b0da0e1c430389d172cfdfaf6d/docs%2Fidentity%2Fapp-provisioning%2Fconfigure-workday-termination-lookahead.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/573236f1560ce2b0da0e1c430389d172cfdfaf6d/docs%2Fidentity%2Fapp-provisioning%2Fconfigure-workday-termination-lookahead.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fapp-provisioning%2Fconfigure-workday-termination-lookahead.md?ref=573236f1560ce2b0da0e1c430389d172cfdfaf6d\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,155 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Configure Workday Termination Lookahead \\\\n+description: Enable Termination Lookahead query for your Workday-to-AD/Microsoft Entra ID provisioning job.\\\\n+author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n+manager: pmwongera\\\\n+ms.service: entra-id\\\\n+ms.subservice: app-provisioning\\\\n+ms.topic: how-to\\\\n+ms.date: 10/24/2025\\\\n+ms.author: jfields\\\\n+ms.reviewer: chmutali\\\\n+ai-usage: ai-assisted\\\\n+\\\\n+#customer intent: As an IT admin, I want to understand how to enable the Workday Termination Lookahead query so I can leverage it for Workday-to-AD/Microsoft Entra ID provisioning.\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Configure Workday termination lookahead (Preview)\\\\n+\\\\n+The Microsoft Entra Workday provisioning connector retrieves worker data using the Workday Integration System User (ISU) account via the `Get_Workers` SOAP API. However, the Workday ISU account always operates in the Pacific Time Zone (PT), causing delays in processing termination events for workers in time zones ahead of PT.\\\\n+\\\\n+For example, let's say a Workday user in **Melbourne (UTC+10, +17 hours ahead of PDT in May)** is terminated with an effective termination date of **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM Melbourne time**. Using the Workday ISU account, the Microsoft Entra Workday connector fetches the termination event in the provisioning cycle that runs after **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT**, which is **May 15, 2025, 4:59 PM Melbourne time**—a significant delay.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> We make public previews available to our customers under the terms applicable to previews. These terms are outlined in the overall Microsoft product terms for [online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).\\\\n+\\\\n+To mitigate this issue, the connector now includes a **24-hour termination lookahead query**. This query ensures termination-related attributes (`StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork`, `StatusTerminationDate`) appear in the connector feed when the termination day begins in PT. The exact processing time varies due to daylight saving time adjustments.\\\\n+\\\\n+Examples of when termination details start appearing in the feed:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Melbourne (UTC+10, PDT+17)** → May 14, 2025, **5:00 PM Melbourne time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Melbourne whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Melbourne time at 5:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 17-hour time difference between PDT and Melbourne time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **India (IST, UTC+5:30, PDT+13.5)** → May 14, 2025, **1:30 PM India time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in India whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting India time 1:30pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 13.5-hour time difference between PDT and Indian Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Japan (JST, UTC+9, PDT+16)** → May 14, 2025, **4:00 PM Japan time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Japan whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Japan time 4:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 16-hour time difference between PDT and Japan Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+This adjustment ensures the termination data is available earlier for workers in time zones ahead of Pacific Time. By updating attribute mapping rules in Microsoft Entra ID, you can then implement time-zone aware terminations.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Job configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user’s access to the resource. For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or Password + text message. The user accesses a resource protected by this policy. \\\\n+Users can register for authentication methods that they're enabled for. An administrator can also configure a user's device by using a method like certificate-based authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-During sign-in, all settings are checked to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods are required by the Conditional Access policy. To sign in, the method must be allowed, registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength. \\\\n+## How an authentication strength policy is evaluated during sign-in\\\\n \\\\n-## How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated \\\\n+A Conditional Access authentication strength policy defines which authentication methods a user can use. Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user's access to the resource.\\\\n \\\\n-In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, all conditions from all policies must be met. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions. For example, if two different authentication strength policies both require passkey (FIDO2), the user can use a FIDO2 security key to satisfy both policies. If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies. \\\\n+For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or a combination of password and text message. The user accesses a resource that this policy helps protect.\\\\n \\\\n-### How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info \\\\n+During sign-in, Microsoft Entra ID checks all settings to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods the Conditional Access policy requires. For a successful sign-in, the method must be allowed, be registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength.\\\\n \\\\n-For security info registration [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode), the authentication strength evaluation is treated differently – authentication strengths that target the user action of **Registering security info** are preferred over other authentication strength policies that target **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')**. All other grant controls (such as **Require device to be marked as compliant**) from other Conditional Access policies in scope for the sign-in will apply as usual.  \\\\n+## How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated\\\\n \\\\n-For example, let’s assume Contoso would like to require their users to always sign in with a multifactor authentication method and from a compliant device. Contoso also wants to allow new employees to register these MFA methods using a Temporary Access Pass (TAP). TAP can’t be used on any other resource. To achieve this goal, the admin can take the following steps: \\\\n+In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, the user must meet all conditions from all policies. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions.\\\\n \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **Bootstrap and recovery** that includes the Temporary Access Pass authentication combination, it can also include any of the MFA methods.  \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **MFA for sign-in** that includes all allowed MFA methods, without Temporary Access Pass.\\\\n-1.

If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies.\\\\n \\\\n-As a result, users on a compliant device would be able to use a Temporary Access Pass to register any MFA method, and then use the newly registered method to authenticate to other resources like Outlook. \\\\n+### How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info\\\\n \\\\n->[!NOTE] \\\\n->- If multiple Conditional Access policies target the **Register security information** user action, and they each apply an authentication strength, the user must satisfy all such authentication strengths to sign in. \\\\n+For [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode) in security info registration, the evaluation of authentication is treated differently.

For more information, see [Create and manage custom Conditional Access authentication strengths](concept-authentication-strength-advanced-options.md).\\\\n \\\\n ## Limitations\\\\n \\\\n-- **Conditional Access policies are only evaluated after the initial authentication** - As a result, authentication strength doesn't restrict a user's initial authentication. Suppose you are using the built-in phishing-resistant MFA strength. A user can still type in their password, but they are required to sign in with a phishing-resistant method such as FIDO2 security key before they can continue.\\\\n+- **Effect of an authentication strength on authentication**: Conditional Access policies are evaluated only after the initial authentication. As a result, an authentication strength doesn't restrict a user's initial authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Require multifactor authentication and Require authentication strength can't be used together in the same Conditional Access policy** - These two Conditional Access grant controls can't be used together because the built-in authentication strength **Multifactor authentication** is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n+  Suppose you're using the built-in **Phishing-resistant MFA strength** authentication strength. A user can still enter a password but must sign in by using a phishing-resistant method, such as a FIDO2 security key, before they can continue.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication methods that aren't currently supported by authentication strength** - The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't included in the available combinations.\\\\n+- **Unsupported combination of grant controls**: You can't use the **Require multifactor authentication** and **Require authentication strength** grant controls together in the same Conditional Access policy. The reason is that the built-in **Multifactor authentication** authentication strength is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Windows Hello for Business** – If the user signed in with Windows Hello for Business as their primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. However, if the user signed in with another method like password as their primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, they aren't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, choose **Sign-in options**, and select a method required by the authentication strength.\\\\n+- **Unsupported authentication method**: The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't currently supported in the available combinations.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Windows Hello for Business**: If the user signs in with Windows Hello for Business as the primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. But if the user signs in with another method (like a password) as the primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, the user isn't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, select **Sign-in options**, and select a method that the authentication strength requires.\\\\n \\\\n ## Known issues\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency** - When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times. \\\\n+- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency**: When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times.\\\\n \\\\n-  For example, let's say a resource requires passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, and a 1-hour sign-in frequency. 24 hours ago, a user signed in with passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource. \\\\n+  For example, let's say a resource requires a passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, along with a 1-hour sign-in frequency. A user signed in with a passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource 24 hours ago.\\\\n   \\\\n-  When the user unlocks their Windows device using Windows Hello for Business, they can access the resource again. Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n+  When the user unlocks their Windows device by using Windows Hello for Business, they can access the resource again. Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n \\\\n ## FAQ\\\\n \\\\n-### Should I use authentication strength or the Authentication methods policy?\\\\n-Authentication strength is based on the Authentication methods policy. The Authentication methods policy helps to scope and configure authentication methods to be used across Microsoft Entra ID by specific users and groups. Authentication strength allows another restriction of methods for specific scenarios, such as sensitive resource access, user risk, location, and more.\\\\n-\\\\n-For example, the administrator of Contoso wants to allow their users to use Microsoft Authenticator with either push notifications or passwordless authentication mode. The administrator goes to the Microsoft Authenticator settings in the Authentication methods policy, scopes the policy for the relevant users, and sets the **Authentication mode** to **Any**. \\\\n+### Should I use an authentication strength or the policy for authentication methods?\\\\n \\\\n-Then for Contoso's most sensitive resource, the administrator wants to restrict the access to only passwordless authentication methods.

The **Authentication methods** policy helps to scope and configure authentication methods that users and groups can use across Microsoft Entra ID. An authentication strength allows another restriction of methods for specific scenarios, such as sensitive resource access, user risk, and location.\\\\n \\\\n-As a result, users in Contoso can access most of the resources in the tenant using password + push notification from the Microsoft Authenticator OR only using Microsoft Authenticator (phone sign-in). However, when the users in the tenant access the sensitive application, they must use Microsoft Authenticator (phone sign-in).\\\\n+For example, assume that the administrator of an organization named Contoso wants to allow users to use Microsoft Authenticator with either push notifications or passwordless authentication mode. The administrator goes to the Authenticator settings in the **Authentication methods** policy, scopes the policy for the relevant users, and sets **Authentication mode** to **Any**.\\\\n \\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n+For Contoso's most sensitive resource, the administrator wants to restrict the access to only passwordless authentication methods. The administrator creates a new Conditional Access policy by using the built-in **Passwordless MFA strength** authentication strength.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Microsoft Entra ID P1** - Your tenant needs to have Microsoft Entra ID P1 license to use Conditional Access. If needed, you can enable a [free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/get-started/start-free-trial).\\\\n+As a result, users in Contoso can access most of the resources in the tenant by using a password and a push notification from Authenticator, or by using only Authenticator (phone sign-in).

It also expands on custom authentication strengths within Conditional Access, offering more granular control over authentication methods for passkeys and certificates. Additionally, documentation updates clarify the functionality of authentication strengths for external users and troubleshooting scenarios, alongside improvements to the Conditional Access agent optimization notification settings.",

Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user’s access to the resource. For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or Password + text message. The user accesses a resource protected by this policy. \\\\n+Users can register for authentication methods that they're enabled for. An administrator can also configure a user's device by using a method like certificate-based authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-During sign-in, all settings are checked to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods are required by the Conditional Access policy. To sign in, the method must be allowed, registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength. \\\\n+## How an authentication strength policy is evaluated during sign-in\\\\n \\\\n-## How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated \\\\n+A Conditional Access authentication strength policy defines which authentication methods a user can use. Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user's access to the resource.\\\\n \\\\n-In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, all conditions from all policies must be met. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions. For example, if two different authentication strength policies both require passkey (FIDO2), the user can use a FIDO2 security key to satisfy both policies. If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies. \\\\n+For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or a combination of password and text message. The user accesses a resource that this policy helps protect.\\\\n \\\\n-### How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info \\\\n+During sign-in, Microsoft Entra ID checks all settings to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods the Conditional Access policy requires. For a successful sign-in, the method must be allowed, be registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength.\\\\n \\\\n-For security info registration [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode), the authentication strength evaluation is treated differently – authentication strengths that target the user action of **Registering security info** are preferred over other authentication strength policies that target **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')**. All other grant controls (such as **Require device to be marked as compliant**) from other Conditional Access policies in scope for the sign-in will apply as usual.  \\\\n+## How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated\\\\n \\\\n-For example, let’s assume Contoso would like to require their users to always sign in with a multifactor authentication method and from a compliant device. Contoso also wants to allow new employees to register these MFA methods using a Temporary Access Pass (TAP). TAP can’t be used on any other resource. To achieve this goal, the admin can take the following steps: \\\\n+In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, the user must meet all conditions from all policies. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions.\\\\n \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **Bootstrap and recovery** that includes the Temporary Access Pass authentication combination, it can also include any of the MFA methods.  \\\\n-1.

Suppose you are using the built-in phishing-resistant MFA strength. A user can still type in their password, but they are required to sign in with a phishing-resistant method such as FIDO2 security key before they can continue.\\\\n+- **Effect of an authentication strength on authentication**: Conditional Access policies are evaluated only after the initial authentication. As a result, an authentication strength doesn't restrict a user's initial authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Require multifactor authentication and Require authentication strength can't be used together in the same Conditional Access policy** - These two Conditional Access grant controls can't be used together because the built-in authentication strength **Multifactor authentication** is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n+  Suppose you're using the built-in **Phishing-resistant MFA strength** authentication strength. A user can still enter a password but must sign in by using a phishing-resistant method, such as a FIDO2 security key, before they can continue.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication methods that aren't currently supported by authentication strength** - The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't included in the available combinations.\\\\n+- **Unsupported combination of grant controls**: You can't use the **Require multifactor authentication** and **Require authentication strength** grant controls together in the same Conditional Access policy. The reason is that the built-in **Multifactor authentication** authentication strength is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Windows Hello for Business** – If the user signed in with Windows Hello for Business as their primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. However, if the user signed in with another method like password as their primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, they aren't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, choose **Sign-in options**, and select a method required by the authentication strength.\\\\n+- **Unsupported authentication method**: The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't currently supported in the available combinations.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Windows Hello for Business**: If the user signs in with Windows Hello for Business as the primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. But if the user signs in with another method (like a password) as the primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, the user isn't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, select **Sign-in options**, and select a method that the authentication strength requires.\\\\n \\\\n ## Known issues\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency** - When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times. \\\\n+- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency**: When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times.\\\\n \\\\n-  For example, let's say a resource requires passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, and a 1-hour sign-in frequency. 24 hours ago, a user signed in with passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource. \\\\n+  For example, let's say a resource requires a passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, along with a 1-hour sign-in frequency. A user signed in with a passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource 24 hours ago.\\\\n   \\\\n-  When the user unlocks their Windows device using Windows Hello for Business, they can access the resource again. Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n+  When the user unlocks their Windows device by using Windows Hello for Business, they can access the resource again. Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n \\\\n ## FAQ\\\\n \\\\n-### Should I use authentication strength or the Authentication methods policy?\\\\n-Authentication strength is based on the Authentication methods policy. The Authentication methods policy helps to scope and configure authentication methods to be used across Microsoft Entra ID by specific users and groups. Authentication strength allows another restriction of methods for specific scenarios, such as sensitive resource access, user risk, location, and more.\\\\n-\\\\n-For example, the administrator of Contoso wants to allow their users to use Microsoft Authenticator with either push notifications or passwordless authentication mode. The administrator goes to the Microsoft Authenticator settings in the Authentication methods policy, scopes the policy for the relevant users, and sets the **Authentication mode** to **Any**. \\\\n+### Should I use an authentication strength or the policy for authentication methods?\\\\n \\\\n-Then for Contoso's most sensitive resource, the administrator wants to restrict the access to only passwordless authentication methods.

However, when the users in the tenant access the sensitive application, they must use Microsoft Authenticator (phone sign-in).\\\\n+For example, assume that the administrator of an organization named Contoso wants to allow users to use Microsoft Authenticator with either push notifications or passwordless authentication mode.

However, the Workday ISU account always operates in the Pacific Time Zone (PT), causing delays in processing termination events for workers in time zones ahead of PT.\\\\n+\\\\n+For example, let's say a Workday user in **Melbourne (UTC+10, +17 hours ahead of PDT in May)** is terminated with an effective termination date of **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM Melbourne time**. Using the Workday ISU account, the Microsoft Entra Workday connector fetches the termination event in the provisioning cycle that runs after **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT**, which is **May 15, 2025, 4:59 PM Melbourne time**—a significant delay.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> We make public previews available to our customers under the terms applicable to previews. These terms are outlined in the overall Microsoft product terms for [online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).\\\\n+\\\\n+To mitigate this issue, the connector now includes a **24-hour termination lookahead query**. This query ensures termination-related attributes (`StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork`, `StatusTerminationDate`) appear in the connector feed when the termination day begins in PT. The exact processing time varies due to daylight saving time adjustments.\\\\n+\\\\n+Examples of when termination details start appearing in the feed:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Melbourne (UTC+10, PDT+17)** → May 14, 2025, **5:00 PM Melbourne time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Melbourne whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Melbourne time at 5:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 17-hour time difference between PDT and Melbourne time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **India (IST, UTC+5:30, PDT+13.5)** → May 14, 2025, **1:30 PM India time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in India whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting India time 1:30pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 13.5-hour time difference between PDT and Indian Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Japan (JST, UTC+9, PDT+16)** → May 14, 2025, **4:00 PM Japan time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Japan whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Japan time 4:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 16-hour time difference between PDT and Japan Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+This adjustment ensures the termination data is available earlier for workers in time zones ahead of Pacific Time. By updating attribute mapping rules in Microsoft Entra ID, you can then implement time-zone aware terminations.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Job configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

However, with lookahead query, you'll now see the change show up as early as May 28, 2025 5pm Melbourne time, so the connector can disable the account based on the expression mapping logic.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Run provision on demand for the worker\\\\n+\\\\n+With the lookahead query, the last day of work for the user was fetched and the `accountEnabled` flag was updated to **False**.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/configure-workday-termination-lookahead/modified-attributes.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A screenshot showing modified attributes.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+### Verify incremental sync performing termination lookahead\\\\n+\\\\n+- After confirming the configuration change works with \\\\\\\"provisioning on demand\\\\\\\", restart your provisioning job.  \\\\n+- Allow the job to reach steady state.

Instead, it relies on the state of the certificate revocation list (CRL) check that's performed when the session was last backed up. If you need to revoke before this backup expires, you should explicitly revoke the session instead of waiting for the CRL.  \\\\n+\\\\n ## Workload identity resilience in the backup authentication system\\\\n \\\\n In addition to user authentication, the backup authentication system provides resilience for [managed identities](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) and other key Azure infrastructure by offering a regionally isolated authentication service that is redundantly layered with the primary authentication service. This system enables the infrastructure authentication within an Azure region to be resilient to issues that might occur in another region or within the larger Microsoft Entra service. This system complements Azure's cross-region architecture. Building your own applications using MI and following Azure's [best practices for resilience and availability]() ensures your applications are highly resilient. In addition to MI, this regionally resilient backup system protects key Azure infrastructure and services that keep the cloud functional.\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"d195efdec37a5b3d380c1262b54a1fa03c2846f0\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/security-copilot/conditional-access-agent-optimization.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/0f827112f19ec66c75c0d8aa01efb6571bc464ad/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fconditional-access-agent-optimization.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/0f827112f19ec66c75c0d8aa01efb6571bc464ad/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fconditional-access-agent-optimization.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fconditional-access-agent-optimization.md?ref=0f827112f19ec66c75c0d8aa01efb6571bc464ad\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -147,7 +147,7 @@ To configure notifications in the Conditional Access optimization agent settings\\\\n \\\\n 1.

      "Response": "This commit introduces a crucial clarification regarding certificate revocation within the backup authentication system. It explains that in an outage, the system relies on previous CRL checks and advises explicit session revocation for immediate effect if necessary. Additionally, a minor refinement has been made to the conditional access agent optimization documentation, clarifying the recipient limits for notifications.",

Several existing articles have also seen updates, with a focus on new videos, API changes, and general availability announcements for features like SAML/WS-Fed federation.\n\nAdditionally, the FAQ for Global Secure Access has been clarified to specify the required cryptographic algorithms for TLS inspection certificates, supporting SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\n\nFinally, an update to the Microsoft Entra ID Governance documentation clarifies that the execution user scope list displays all users meeting the conditions, regardless of whether they have already been processed by the workflow.",

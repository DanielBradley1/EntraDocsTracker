    "Response": "This update clarifies the supported versions of SQL Server for Microsoft Entra Connect, explicitly stating that SQL Server 2012 and 2016 are no longer supported, while continuing to support versions up to SQL Server 2022. It also reiterates that Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance are not supported. The changes maintain existing requirements regarding case-insensitive collations, single sync engines per SQL instance, and the bundled ODBC/OLE DB drivers.",

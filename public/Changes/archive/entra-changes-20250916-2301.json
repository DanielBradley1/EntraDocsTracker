Features like self-service password reset let users update or change their passwords using a web browser from any device. This feature is especially useful when the user has forgotten their password or their account is locked. Without waiting for a helpdesk or administrator to provide support, a user can unblock themselves and continue to work.\\\\n+Microsoft Entra ID helps protect users' identities and simplify their sign-in experience. Features like SSPR let users update or change their passwords by using a web browser from any device. This feature is especially useful when users forget their passwords or their accounts are locked. Without waiting for a helpdesk or administrator to provide support, users can unblock themselves and continue to work.\\\\n \\\\n-Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication lets users choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or mobile app notification. This ability reduces the requirement for a single, fixed form of secondary authentication like a hardware token. If the user doesn't currently have one form of additional authentication, they can choose a different method and continue to work.\\\\n+MFA lets users choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or a mobile app notification.

This ability can reduce the complexity of managing passwords across environments.\\\\n \\\\n ## Self-service password reset\\\\n \\\\n-Self-service password reset gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement.

For example, the user is prompted to enter a code on a phone or to provide a fingerprint scan.\\\\n \\\\n-If you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, is it really the user signing in with the username and password, or is it an attacker? When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased as this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\\\\n+If you use only a password to authenticate a user, it leaves a nonsecure vector for attack.

Why is that?\\\\n+        answer: |\\\\n+          The IP address shown in the audit logs represents the OAuth client's IP address. This refers to the ipAddress of the TCP peer connecting to the service endpoint performing the action. In some cases, such as public applications or single-page web apps, the OAuth client can be the end user. However, in most situations, the IP address in the audit logs is that of the client application that received an access token to directly access a service and carry out an auditable action.\\\\n \\\\n   - name: Sign-in logs\\\\n     questions:\\\"\\r\\n  }\\r\\n].

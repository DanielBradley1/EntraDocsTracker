These providers offer comprehensive fraud protection solutions that enable organizations to detect and block automated attacks, such as bot-driven registrations, during the user sign-up process.  \\\\n+\\\\n+By integrating Arkose Labs, HUMAN, or both with Microsoft Entra External ID, you can leverage their advanced risk assessment capabilities to ensure that only legitimate users create accounts.  \\\\n+\\\\n+This article explains how to integrate fraud protection providers with Microsoft Entra External ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+::: zone pivot=\\\\\\\"arkose\\\\\\\"\\\\n+\\\\n+## How Arkose Labs works\\\\n+\\\\n+When a user attempts to sign up, the Arkose Labs service evaluates the request and determines if it's likely to be fraudulent. If the request is flagged as suspicious, the user is presented with a challenge (like a CAPTCHA) to verify that they're human. If the user successfully completes the challenge, they can proceed with the sign-up process. Once this feature is enabled, you'll be able to view Arkose challenge metrics in the Arkose Labs dashboard. Additionally, you can fine-tune risk policies by coordinating with Arkose Labs support.\\\\n+\\\\n+You can complete the integration in both the Microsoft Entra admin center and the Microsoft Graph API. This article provides instructions for the Microsoft Entra admin center.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- An [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).\\\\n+- A [registered application](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) in the tenant.\\\\n+- An account with at least an [Authentication Extensibility Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-extensibility-administrator) or [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) role in the external tenant.\\\\n+- An Arkose Labs account.

To address this, Entra External ID supports integration with third-party fraud detection providers such as HUMAN Security. This integration enables real-time analysis of sign-up attempts, leveraging HUMAN Security’s advanced detection algorithms to identify and block suspicious activity before account creation is completed. The solution is natively integrated with Microsoft identity infrastructure, allowing for streamlined deployment and management. By implementing this approach, organizations can access detailed telemetry and actionable insights to monitor sign-up flows, fine-tune detection thresholds, and respond proactively to emerging threats, thereby maintaining the integrity of their user base.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- An [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).\\\\n+- A [registered application](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) in the tenant.\\\\n+- An account with at least an [Authentication Extensibility Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-extensibility-administrator) or [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) role in the external tenant.\\\\n+- Create a HUMAN Security account: Contact Human Security (entra@humansecurity.com) to create and set up a free HUMAN Security account. \\\\n+- The following configuration values from HUMAN Security:\\\\n+  - Application ID\\\\n+  - Server token\\\\n+\\\\n+You can find these values in the HUMAN Security admin console in the [application settings](https://docs.humansecurity.com/applications-and-accounts/docs/managing-applications#adding-server-tokens) page. If you're unsure about any value, contact HUMAN Security for assistance.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Configure HUMAN Security in the Microsoft Entra admin center\\\\n+\\\\n+To integrate HUMAN Security with Microsoft Entra External ID, you can use the Service Integration wizard in Microsoft Entra admin center to create a fraud protection provider policy.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1.

    "Response": "This commit introduces a new how-to guide for integrating fraud protection services, specifically Arkose Labs and HUMAN Security, with Microsoft Entra External ID. The document outlines the prerequisites and step-by-step instructions for configuring these integrations via the Microsoft Entra admin centre to help prevent bot attacks and fake account creation during user sign-up flows. Additionally, supporting image files and YAML configuration updates for zone pivoting have been added to reflect this new content.",

There are three methods in which you can register a Mac device with Platform SSO (PSSO), secure enclave, smart card, or password. We recommend using secure enclave or smart card for the best passwordless experience, however shared or multi-user Macs may benefit from using the password method instead. Common scenarios for shared Macs with passwords would be computer labs in schools or universities.

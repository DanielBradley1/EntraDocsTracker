It's not supported for non-standard sign-in pages, like those that use Adobe Flash or other non-HTML-enabled technologies.\\\\n-\\\\n-There are two ways to capture sign-in fields for your custom apps:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Automatic sign-in field capture** works well with most HTML-enabled sign-in pages, *if they use well-known DIV IDs* for the user name and password fields. The HTML on the page is scraped to find DIV IDs that match certain criteria. That metadata is saved so that it can be replayed to the app later.\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Manual sign-in field capture** is used if the app vendor *doesn't label the sign-in input fields*. Manual capture is also used if the vendor *renders multiple fields that can't be auto-detected*. Microsoft Entra ID can store data for as many fields as there are on the sign-in page, if you tell it where those fields are on the page.\\\\n-\\\\n-In general, if automatic sign-in field capture doesn't work, try the manual option.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### Automatically capture sign-in fields for an app\\\\n-\\\\n-To configure password-based SSO by using automatic sign-in field capture, follow these steps:\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator). \\\\n-1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **All applications**.\\\\n-1. Select the app that you want to configure for SSO.\\\\n-1. After the app loads, select **Single sign-on** in the navigation pane on the left side.\\\\n-1. Select **Password-based Sign-on** mode.\\\\n-1. Enter the **Sign-on URL**, which is the URL of the page where users enter their user name and password to sign in. *Make sure that the sign-in fields are visible on the page for the URL that you provide*.\\\\n-1. Select **Save**.\\\\n-    The page is automatically scraped for the user name and password input boxes. You can now use Microsoft Entra ID to securely transmit passwords to that app by using the My Apps browser extension.\\\\n+Sign-in field capture is supported only for HTML-enabled sign-in pages.

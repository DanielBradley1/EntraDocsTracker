This feature allows admins to ask questions about their tenant, such as the tenant ID, display name, and active licenses. It also provides insights into the technical and security compliance contacts for the tenant, and whether users can create new tenants.\\\\n-\\\\n-This feature requires a minimum of the [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader) role in Microsoft Entra ID, and can be used with any tenant and Microsoft Entra ID license.\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate alerts in Scenario Health Monitoring:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *What is my tenant's display name?*\\\\n-- *What is my tenant ID?*\\\\n-- *What are all the active licenses assigned to my tenant?*\\\\n-- *Who is the technical contact for my tenant?*\\\\n-- *Who is the security compliance contact for my tenant?*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Users\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Security Copilot streamlines user management in Microsoft Entra by enabling IT administrators to quickly view user details, manage roles, and troubleshoot access issues using natural language queries. This capability helps keep user identities secure and up to date, reducing time spent navigating portals and improving response times for user-related requests.\\\\n-\\\\n-This feature is available to users with the minimum role of [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator), and can be used with any tenant and Microsoft Entra ID license.\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate and manage users in Microsoft Entra:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *Show recently deleted users*\\\\n-- *Tell me about myself*\\\\n-- *Are there guest users in the Human Resources department?*\\\\n-- *Show transitive reports of Brandon Artois*\\\\n-- *Give the member count of each department*\\\\n-- *What are Abbi Atin’s authentication methods?*\\\\n-- *Who is Asha Brunelle's manager?*\\\\n-- *Is Blake Martin's account cloud managed?*\\\\n-- *Show users by mail nickname*\\\\n-- *List users without assigned licenses*\\\\n-- *List users in Finance or Marketing department*\\\\n-- *Show users not in {Company Name}*\\\\n-- *Show users with account disabled*\\\\n-- *How many users are reporting to Brandon Artois?*\\\\n-- *Look up Abadi Bod’s permissions*\\\\n-- *Are there any users with {Specific license}?*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Groups\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Security Copilot streamlines Microsoft Entra Groups management by enabling IT administrators to quickly view group configurations, manage memberships, and identify group hygiene issues such as ownerless groups. By providing relevant group information in context, Copilot helps minimize time spent navigating portals and improves response times for group-related tasks.\\\\n-\\\\n-This feature is available with a free Microsoft Entra license and in any public cloud tenant which contains one or more groups.\\\\n-\\\\n-Users assigned the following roles can use this feature:\\\\n-\\\\n-- [Directory Writer](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-writer)\\\\n-- [Groups Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#groups-administrator)\\\\n-- [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator)\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate and manage groups in Microsoft Entra:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *Count the total ownerless groups in my tenant*\\\\n-- *Count the total user memberships for a group*\\\\n-- *Provide separate counts for users, groups, devices, and service principals in a group*\\\\n-- *How many different object types does a group have in total?*\\\\n-- *Show me all user members of a group*\\\\n-- *Which users are included in a group?*\\\\n-- *What directory roles are assigned to a group?*\\\\n-- *Does this group have any built-in roles?*\\\\n-- *Show the count of groups categorized by group type*\\\\n-- *List the number of groups under each of the group types*\\\\n-- *How many groups exist for each group type?*\\\\n-- *Show me the membership rules for a group*\\\\n-- *Is the dynamic membership rule currently processing for a group?*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Devices\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra uses the capabilities of Security Copilot to help administrators investigate their Microsoft Entra ID devices using natural language queries. This feature allows admins to quickly access device information, such as device IDs, compliance status, activity and whether devices are Entra ID registered, joined or hybrid joined.\\\\n-\\\\n-This feature is available using a free Microsoft Entra ID license, and to any user in any tenant.\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate devices in Microsoft Entra:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *Show me the device for with an ID of {ID}*\\\\n-- *Show me all compliant devices/Show me all non-compliant devices*\\\\n-- *List devices that are not under management*\\\\n-- *List all devices that are Entra ID registered/Entra ID joined/Entra ID hybrid joined*\\\\n-- *Show me when device {ID} was last active*\\\\n-- *List the devices with specific {operating system name}*\\\\n-- *Show me how many devices are running Windows (8,10,11)*\\\\n-- *Show the count of Windows devices categorized by release*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Roles and administrators\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Microsoft Entra resources by assigning roles to users, groups, or applications. You can use built-in roles or create custom roles with specific permissions to meet your organization's needs. You can now use Microsoft Security Copilot to investigate roles within a directory. For example, you can ask which roles a user or group has, who has a specific role, or get details about a particular role. This makes it easier for administrators and analysts to understand and manage role assignments across your environment.\\\\n-\\\\n-Users assigned the following roles can use this feature:\\\\n-\\\\n-- [Directory Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-readers)\\\\n-- [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader)\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate roles in Microsoft Entra:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *What role does user/group/app <name/email/id> have?*\\\\n-- *What are the transitive roles user/group/app <name/email/id> has?*\\\\n-- *What are the eligible roles user/group/app <name/email/id> has?*\\\\n-- *What are the scheduled roles user/group/app <name/email/id> has?*\\\\n-- *Who has the Cloud Application Administrator role assigned to them?*\\\\n-- *Who has eligibility for the Global Reader role?*\\\\n-\\\\n-For more information, see:\\\\n-\\\\n-- [Overview of role-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview)\\\\n-- [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator)\\\\n-\\\\n-### Domain services\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra uses the capabilities of Security Copilot to simplify domain management in the Microsoft Entra admin center. This feature allows administrators to quickly access domain information, verify DNS records, and manage domain settings using natural language queries.\\\\n-\\\\n-Using this feature requires a minimum of the [Domain Name Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#domain-name-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID, and can be used with any tenant and Microsoft Entra ID license.\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate alerts in domain services:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *List details of contoso.com*\\\\n-- *Show me DNS verification records of contoso.com*\\\\n-- *What is my initial domain name?*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Conditional Access\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Conditional Access applies the capabilities of Microsoft Security Copilot to help admins easily understand and evaluate their Conditional Access policies. By combining Conditional Access APIs with the power of generative AI, Security Copilot enables analysts to ask natural language questions, such as identifying what policies apply to users or what policies use certain controls, and receive clear insights in seconds.\\\\n-\\\\n-Using this feature requires at least the roles of [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator), [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader), or [Security Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-reader). You will also need a [Microsoft Entra ID P1 license](/entra/id-protection/overview-identity-protection#license-requirements) and a tenant with Conditional Access policies configured.\\\\n-\\\\n-- *List active MFA Conditional Access policies in my tenant.*\\\\n-- *Which MFA policies are enforced in my tenant?*\\\\n-- *Which Conditional Access policies are enabled in my tenant?*\\\\n-- *Which CA policies should I enable?*\\\\n-- *Which CA policies are not enabled in my tenant?*\\\\n-- *List all inactive Conditional Access policies in my tenant.*\\\\n-- *List CA policies that are currently active in my tenant.*\\\\n-- *Which Conditional Access policies in my tenant exclude trusted locations?*\\\\n-- *Get all CA policies for user by group.*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Authentication\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Security Copilot empowers administrators to quickly assess and manage authentication methods across their Microsoft Entra tenant. By using natural language queries, you can easily discover which authentication methods are enabled, understand user registration status, and identify potential gaps in your organization's authentication strategy. This capability streamlines security management, helping you ensure that strong authentication practices are in place to protect your users and resources.\\\\n-\\\\n-Using this feature requires a minimum of the [Authentication Policy Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-policy-administrator) for tenant level configurations or [Privileged Authentication Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-authentication-administrator) for user level configurations in Microsoft Entra ID, and can be used with any tenant and Microsoft Entra ID license.\\\\n-\\\\n-The following example prompts can be used to investigate MFA and authentication methods in Microsoft Entra:\\\\n-\\\\n-- *What authentication methods are enabled in my tenant?*\\\\n-- *Is Microsoft Authenticator enabled in my tenant? For who?*\\\\n-- *Is report suspicious activity enabled in my tenant? For who?*\\\\n-- *What authentication methods does karita@woodgrovebank.com have registered?*\\\\n-- *Is user karita@woodgrovebank.com enabled for per-user MFA?*\\\\n-- *How many users have the FIDO2 Security keys method registered?*\\\\n-\\\\n-### Sign-in logs\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Security Copilot streamlines the process of reviewing and troubleshooting sign-in activities in Microsoft Entra.

Network traffic analysis skills allow network administrators and security teams to analyze user, device, and branch network usage, identify network issues, and detect threats or policy violations in real time without the need to write complex queries.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access scenarios supported by Microsoft Security Copilot\\\\n+\\\\n+Security Copilot is integrated into the Microsoft Entra admin center and works seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID Protection features. The following table provides an overview of the scenarios supported by Security Copilot:\\\\n+\\\\n+| Scenario | Role(s) | License | Tenant |\\\\n+|----------|---------|---------|--------|\\\\n+| [Global Secure Access](#global-secure-access) | [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator)<br>[Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader)<br>[Global Secure Access Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator)<br>[Global Secure Access Log Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-log-reader) | [Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license](/entra/id-protection/overview-identity-protection#license-requirements)<br>Entra Private Access License (for private access traffic)<br>Entra Internet Access License (for general internet traffic outside Microsoft services) | Global Secure Access configured |\\\\n+\\\\n+Using Security Copilot, you can apply its capabilities with Global Secure Access in the following use cases:\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Monitor data consumption and bandwidth usage](#monitor-data-consumption-and-bandwidth-usage)\\\\n+- [Investigate blocked traffic and security threats](#investigate-blocked-traffic-and-security-threats)\\\\n+- [Analyze user application access patterns](#analyze-user-application-access-patterns)\\\\n+- [Monitor cross-tenant access and external connections](#monitor-cross-tenant-access-and-external-connections)\\\\n+\\\\n+## Global Secure Access\\\\n+\\\\n+For example, as a security analyst or network administrator, you can use Security Copilot to investigate and monitor network traffic usage and behavior using natural language queries. You can analyze user, device, and branch network usage, identify network issues, and detect threats or policy violations in real time. As a result, your investigation process is streamlined and more effective. \\\\n+\\\\n+### Monitor data consumption and bandwidth usage\\\\n+\\\\n+You can begin your investigation by analyzing overall network traffic patterns and identifying users with high data consumption. Understanding bandwidth usage and traffic distribution are crucial for capacity planning, identifying potential security issues, and detecting unusual usage patterns that might indicate compromised accounts or policy violations. Use the following example prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Show the top 5 users with the highest data consumption in the last day.*\\\\n+- *List the top 10 accessed applications names in the last week based on network traffic logs.*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Investigate blocked traffic and security threats\\\\n+\\\\n+Next, you should investigate blocked traffic and security threats to identify potential security incidents and ensure that your organization's security policies are effectively enforced. Analyzing blocked traffic can help you detect malicious activities, misconfigurations, or policy violations that could compromise your network's security. Use the following example prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Show all blocked traffic for user david.analyst@woodgrovebank.com in the last 24 hours.*\\\\n+- *List all applications with high-risk scores accessed in the last 24 hours based on network traffic logs.*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Analyze user application access patterns\\\\n+\\\\n+You can analyze specific user access patterns to understand application usage, identify unusual behavior, and ensure compliance with corporate access policies. This analysis helps identify potential insider threats, compromised accounts, or unauthorized application usage that could pose security risks. Use the following example prompt to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *List all applications names that user sarah.manager@woodgrovebank.com has accessed in the last 24 hours based on network traffic logs.*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Monitor cross-tenant access and external connections\\\\n+\\\\n+Finally, you should monitor cross-tenant traffic to identify any unauthorized external connections, to prevent unauthorized data access and movement. Use the following example prompt to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Show all cross-tenant traffic to tenant aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee in the last 7 days based on network traffic logs.*\\\\n+\\\\n+## Related content\\\\n+\\\\n+- Learn more about [Global Secure Access](/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access)\\\\n+- [How to use the Global Secure Access traffic logs (preview)](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-view-traffic-logs)\\\\n\\\\\\\\ No newline at end of file\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"ec115cc3f12a2e367b98ac3ccffa7000964502be\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/security-copilot/entra-investigate-incident.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"renamed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 8,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 8,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 16,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/0a42bc21182bcfde42ba3e42503d19a1b8aa402b/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fentra-investigate-incident.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/0a42bc21182bcfde42ba3e42503d19a1b8aa402b/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fentra-investigate-incident.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fentra-investigate-incident.md?ref=0a42bc21182bcfde42ba3e42503d19a1b8aa402b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,11 +1,11 @@\\\\n ---\\\\n title: Investigate identity risk in Microsoft Security Copilot\\\\n description: Use Microsoft Security Copilot and Microsoft Entra skills to quickly investigate identity-based security incident.\\\\n-keywords:\\\\n author: cilwerner\\\\n ms.author: cwerner\\\\n manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.date: 11/7/2024\\\\n+ms.reviewer: ptyagi\\\\n+ms.date: 09/23/2025\\\\n ms.update-cycle: 180-days\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n ms.service: entra\\\\n@@ -20,13 +20,13 @@ ms.collection: msec-ai-copilot\\\\n \\\\n This article describes how a SOC analyst or IT admin could use the Microsoft Entra skills to investigate a potential security incident. \\\\n \\\\n-## Scenario\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n \\\\n-Natasha, a security operations center (SOC) analyst at Woodgrove Bank, receives an alert about a potential identity-based security incident.

Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *What role does user/group/app (name/email/ID) have?*\\\\n+- *What are the transitive roles user/group/app (name/email/ID) has?*\\\\n+- *What are the eligible roles user/group/app (name/email/ID) has?*\\\\n+- *What are the scheduled roles user/group/app (name/email/ID) has?*\\\\n+- *Who has the Cloud Application Administrator role assigned to them?*\\\\n+- *Who has eligibility for the Global Reader role?*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Role information and identification\\\\n+\\\\n+You can then examine specific roles and their identifiers to understand the scope of permissions and ensure that role assignments align with business requirements and security policies. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *What is the ID of role (role name)*\\\\n+- *Name of the role with ID 5d6b6bb7-de71-4623-b4af-96380a352509*\\\\n+\\\\n+## Configure authentication methods and policies\\\\n+\\\\n+Next, you should assess and manage authentication methods across your Microsoft Entra tenant to ensure strong authentication practices are in place to protect users and resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Authentication method configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+Next, you can assess the authentication methods to ensure that strong practices are in place and that multifactor authentication (MFA) is properly configured to protect against unauthorized access. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *What authentication methods are enabled in my tenant?*\\\\n+- *Is Microsoft Authenticator enabled in my tenant? For who?*\\\\n+- *Is registration campaign enabled in my tenant? For who?*\\\\n+- *Is system preferred authentication enabled in my tenant? For who?*\\\\n+- *Is report suspicious activity enabled in my tenant? For who?*\\\\n+\\\\n+### User authentication status\\\\n+\\\\n+You can then review individual user authentication configurations and registration status to ensure compliance with security policies and identify any users who may need assistance with their authentication setup. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *What authentication methods does karita@woodgrovebank.com have registered?*\\\\n+- *Is user karita@woodgrovebank.com enabled for per-user MFA?*\\\\n+- *How many users have the FIDO2 Security keys method registered?*\\\\n+\\\\n+## Monitor and manage device compliance\\\\n+\\\\n+You can continue your assessment by monitoring and investigating device compliance across your organization. Device compliance is crucial for many organizations to ensure that only secure and compliant devices can access sensitive information and corporate resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Device identification and status\\\\n+\\\\n+By examining device details and compliance status, you can ensure that devices accessing your organization's resources meet security standards and policies. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Show me the device for with an ID of {ID}*\\\\n+- *Show me all compliant devices/Show me all non-compliant devices.*\\\\n+- *List devices that are not under management.*\\\\n+- *How many devices are there?*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Device join types and configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+You can also investigate device join types and configurations to ensure that devices are properly registered and managed within your Microsoft Entra setup. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *List all devices that are Entra ID registered/Entra ID joined/Entra ID hybrid joined.*\\\\n+- *How many devices exist for each device trust type?*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Device activity and operating systems\\\\n+\\\\n+Next, you should look into device activity and operating systems to ensure that devices are actively managed and running supported, secure operating systems. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Show me when device {ID} was last active.*\\\\n+- *List the devices with specific {operating system name}.*\\\\n+- *Show me how many devices are running Windows (8,10,11).*\\\\n+- *Show the count of Windows devices categorized by release.*\\\\n+\\\\n+## Analyze Conditional Access policies\\\\n+\\\\n+Finally, you should evaluate your organization's Conditional Access policies to ensure that proper access controls are in place and that your organization's security requirements are being enforced consistently across all users and devices.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Policy identification and status\\\\n+\\\\n+You can examine the current state of Conditional Access policies to understand which policies are active and ensure that critical security controls are properly enforced. Use the following prompts to get the information you need:\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Authentication strength policies.*\\\\n+- *Conditional Access policy by name.*\\\\n+- *Active Multifactor Authentication Conditional Access Policies.*\\\\n+- *Enforced MFA policies.*\\\\n+- *Enabled Conditional Access Policies.*\\\\n+- *CA Policies currently enforced.*\\\\n+- *Actively enforced CA Policies.*\\\\n+\\\\n+### Policy configuration and management\\\\n+\\\\n+Finally, you can investigate specific policy configurations to identify any gaps in coverage and ensure that policies align with your organization's security posture and compliance requirements.\\\\n+\\\\n+- *Conditional Access Policies to enable.*\\\\n+- *What CA Policies are not currently enabled?*\\\\n+- *What policies can I enable?*\\\\n+- *List inactive Conditional Access Policies/*\\\\n+- *Conditional Access Policies.*\\\\n+- *List CA policies.*\\\\n+- *What CA Policies not applicable to trusted locations?*\\\\n+- *Conditional Access Policies excluding all trusted locations.*\\\\n+- *Get all conditional access policies for user considering the groups.*\\\\n+\\\\n+## Related content\\\\n+\\\\n+- Learn more about [role-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview)\\\\n+- Learn more about [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator)\\\\n+- Learn more about [authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)\\\\n+- Learn more about [Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"6a4d8c7fc99d0049983944b74ff84459fe08b776\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/security-copilot/entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 69,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 69,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/0a42bc21182bcfde42ba3e42503d19a1b8aa402b/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fentra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/0a42bc21182bcfde42ba3e42503d19a1b8aa402b/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fentra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fsecurity-copilot%2Fentra-security-scenarios.md?ref=0a42bc21182bcfde42ba3e42503d19a1b8aa402b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,69 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Microsoft Security Copilot scenarios in Microsoft Entra overview\\\\n+description: Learn about the Microsoft Security Copilot scenarios across Microsoft Entra products and services.\\\\n+author: cilwerner\\\\n+ms.author: cwerner\\\\n+manager: pmwongera\\\\n+ms.reviewer: ptyagi\\\\n+ms.date: 09/23/2025\\\\n+ms.update-cycle: 180-days\\\\n+ms.topic: concept-article\\\\n+ms.service: entra\\\\n+ms.custom: security-copilot\\\\n+ms.collection: msec-ai-copilot\\\\n+# Customer intent: As an identity administrator, I want to understand the Microsoft Security Copilot scenarios available across Microsoft Entra products so I can improve my organization's security posture.\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Microsoft Security Copilot scenarios in Microsoft Entra overview\\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Security Copilot is a powerful tool that can help you manage and secure your Microsoft Entra identity environment.

The document's modification date has also been updated.\n*   **FIDO2 Compatibility:** The \"concept-fido2-compatibility.md\" document has had its modification date updated and a reviewer changed. Additionally, it clarifies that BLE and NFC security keys are not supported on Android by Google, and security key registration with Microsoft Entra ID is also not supported on Android.\n*   **Conditional Access Agent Optimization:** Two documents related to Conditional Access agent optimization have been updated. \"agent-optimization-review-suggestions.md\" has had its title changed from \"Review policy reports (Preview)\" to \"Review policy reports\" and a minor wording adjustment. \"howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md\" has seen its modification date updated, a reviewer updated, and the prerequisites for using the insights and reporting workbook clarified to include access to the Log Analytics workspace, along with appropriate permissions for both the security reader role and the workspace.",

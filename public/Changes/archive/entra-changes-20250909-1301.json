OR, just the [Global Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator) role.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Configure a restriction\\\\n+\\\\n+You can configure app management policies in Microsoft Entra ID using either the Microsoft Entra admin center or Microsoft Graph API. \\\\n+\\\\n+### Enable a restriction for all applications\\\\n+\\\\n+This example blocks the addition of new passwords on all applications and service principals in your organization.

This example grants an app an exception to the restriction blocking custom identifier URIs, so it can still have custom URIs added to it. A similar process can be followed for other restrictions.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [Microsoft Entra admin center](#tab/portal)\\\\n+\\\\n+To grant an app an exception to the restriction blocking custom identifier URIs using the Microsoft Entra admin center:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **App management policies**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Block custom identifier URIs**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Ensure the status is **On**. Set the 'Applies to' field to **All applications with exclusions**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Excluded apps**, select **Add applications**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Choose the application you'd like to exclude from the restriction.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Save** to save your settings.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/configure-app-management-policies/identifier-uri-restriction-with-exemption.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the 'custom identifier URI' restriction.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [Microsoft Graph](#tab/graph)\\\\n+\\\\n+To grant an app an exception to the restriction blocking custom identifier URIs using the Microsoft Graph:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Create a new custom app management policy. When creating it, set the `nonDefaultUriAddition` restriction under `restrictions.applicationRestrictions` to `disabled`. \\\\n+\\\\n+    ```http\\\\n+    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/appManagementPolicies\\\\n+\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"restrictions\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+            \\\\\\\"applicationRestrictions\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+                \\\\\\\"identifierUris\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+                    \\\\\\\"nonDefaultUriAddition\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+                        \\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"disabled\\\\\\\"\\\\n+                    }\\\\n+                }\\\\n+            }\\\\n+        }\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Record the ID of the new policy from the response. \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Assign the new custom policy to the application you'd like to exempt.\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```http\\\\n+    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/{objectIdOfTheApplication}/appManagementPolicies/$ref\\\\n+\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"@odata.id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/policies/appManagementPolicies/{idOfTheCustomPolicy}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. If you get an error indicating that this application already has a custom policy assigned, then instead modify that policy to include this new exclusion. Make sure the existing policy isn't assigned to any other applications, or they'll also receive the exclusion.\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Grant an exception to a user or service\\\\n+\\\\n+Sometimes, exceptions need to be granted to the user or service creating or modifying the application. For example, imagine an automated process in your organization periodically creates applications and sets passwords on them. You want to block the new passwords in your organization, but you don't want to break this automated process while you're working on updating it.  [Application exceptions](#grant-an-exception-to-an-application) wouldn't work in this case, because the apps being created/updated don't exist yet! Instead, you can apply an exception to the process itself.  \\\\n+\\\\n+This type of exception - sometimes labeled an 'actor' or 'caller' exception - is configured using [custom security attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-overview). Because of this, you need two additional roles for this scenario, in addition to the roles from [prerequisites](#prerequisites).\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Attribute Definition Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#attribute-definition-administrator)\\\\n+- [Attribute Assignment Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#attribute-assignment-administrator)\\\\n+\\\\n+This example grants a service an exception to the restriction enforcing a max lifetime on new certificates it adds to other applications and service principals. The service will be represented by its service principal. Find the service principal for a service by searching for it in [Enterprise applications](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/~/AppAppsPreview).\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [Microsoft Entra admin center](#tab/portal)\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Select **Restrict max certificate lifetime**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Ensure the status is **On**. Set the 'Applies to' field to **All applications with exclusions**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Excluded callers**, select **Add excluded callers**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Choose the user or service principal whose calls to create/update apps you'd like to exclude from the restriction.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Custom security attributes are key-value pairs; they require a definition for the key-value pair to be created in the tenant, and then instances of the key-value pair can be added to specific users or service principals.\\\\n+\\\\n+Custom security attribute definitions can be [created through the Microsoft Entra admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-add), but you can also do so using Microsoft Graph. First, [create an attribute set](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/directory-post-attributesets) (if you don't have one already).

    "Response": "This commit introduces comprehensive documentation on configuring app management policies within Microsoft Entra ID. The new content, `configure-app-management-policies.md`, details how to set restrictions on application and service principal configurations to enhance security. It covers various restrictions, including those related to key lifetimes, URI additions, and password/symmetric key management, and provides step-by-step guidance for implementation via both the Microsoft Entra admin centre and Microsoft Graph API. Several images have also been added to illustrate the admin centre configuration steps. The `toc.yml` file has been updated to include a link to the new `configure-app-management-policies.md` documentation.",

These identities are synchronized using tools like Microsoft Entra Connect, allowing users to access both cloud-based and on-premises resources with a single set of credentials. This setup enables seamless authentication and single sign-on (SSO) experiences across environments.

It reduces and in some cases eliminates the need for direct connectivity to domain controllers.

It reduces (and in some cases, eliminates) the need for direct connectivity to domain controllers.\\\\n \\\\n-**Enhanced security with modern credentials support**: Users can sign in using passwordless methods such as Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys yet still access on-premises resources protected by Kerberos. Enables multifactor and password-less authentication, reducing risks associated with password theft and phishing attacks.\\\\n+For example, when a Microsoft Entra ID-joined Windows client accesses a file share or application over the internet, Microsoft Entra ID can issue the necessary Kerberos tickets as a KDC associated with the resource.\\\\n \\\\n-**Simplified Hybrid join**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos supports hybrid join scenarios without requiring ADFS or Microsoft Entra Connect sync. This is ideal for non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), disconnected forests, and Azure Virtual Desktop.\\\\n+**Enhanced security with modern credentials support**: Users can sign in by using passwordless methods such as Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys, yet still access on-premises resources that have Kerberos protections. This ability enables multifactor authentication (MFA) and passwordless authentication to reduce the risks associated with password theft and phishing attacks.\\\\n \\\\n-**Secure ticket exchange**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos uses a secure Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) exchange model.\\\\n+**Simplified hybrid join**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos supports hybrid join scenarios without requiring Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or Microsoft Entra Connect Sync. This support is ideal for nonpersistent virtual desktop infrastructure, disconnected forests, and Azure Virtual Desktop.\\\\n \\\\n-**Scalable group memberships**: Addresses traditional Kerberos limitations with large or dynamic group memberships, improving reliability and user experience. In scenarios involving large groups of users, performance is optimized through automatic load distribution across all domain controllers (DCs) within a site. For deployments in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments, we recommend ensuring that sufficient DCs are available and geographically close to the environment to maintain responsiveness.\\\\n+**Secure ticket exchange**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos uses a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) exchange model for enhanced security.\\\\n \\\\n+**Scalable group memberships**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos addresses traditional Kerberos limitations with large or dynamic group memberships to improve reliability and user experience.

When a user signs in to a Windows device that is either Microsoft Entra IDâ€‘joined or hybrid joined, the device authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID and receives a [Primary Refresh Token](../devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md). In addition to the PRT, Entra ID issues a Cloud Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the realm KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM, a partial TGT to access on-premises resources. In this model, Microsoft Entra ID acts as the Key Distribution Center (KDC), facilitating secure and seamless authentication.\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Kerberos allows your Microsoft Entra ID tenant to operate as a dedicated Kerberos realm alongside your existing on-premises Active Directory realm.

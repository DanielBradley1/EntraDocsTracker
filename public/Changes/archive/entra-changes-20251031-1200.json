Each application can have its own theme that you can customize with a background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. This customization overrides any configurations made to the default branding. If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements are displayed.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article describes how you can create multiple branding themes for different applications in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Have at least the [Organizational Branding Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator) role.\\\\n+- Have at least the [Application Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role for applications that you want to apply a theme to.\\\\n+- A registered application in your tenant. If you haven't registered an application yet, see [Register an application](../../identity-platform/quickstart-register-app.md).\\\\n+- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Branding theme properties\\\\n+\\\\n+When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the sign-in page, with each of the default branding elements highlighted.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+| Property | Description |\\\\n+| --- | --- |\\\\n+| Favicon | Small icon that appears on the left side of the browser tab. |\\\\n+| Header | Space across the top of the sign-in page, behind the header log. |\\\\n+| Header logo | Logo that appears in the upper-left corner of the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Background image | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Page background color | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Banner logo | Logo that appears at the top of the sign-in box |\\\\n+| Sign-in page title | Larger text that appears below the banner logo. |\\\\n+| Sign-in page description | Text to describe the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Username hint and text | The text that appears before a user enters their information. |\\\\n+| Sign-in display message box | Text you can add below the username field. |\\\\n+| Footer link: Privacy & Cookies | Link you can add to the lower-right corner for privacy information. |\\\\n+| Footer: Terms of Use | Text in the lower-right corner of the page where you can add Terms of use information. |\\\\n+| Footer | Space across the bottom of the page for privacy and Terms of Use information. |\\\\n+| Template | The layout of the page and sign-in boxes. |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How branding themes work\\\\n+\\\\n+Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.\\\\n+- **Default branding (company branding)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.\\\\n+- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.\\\\n+- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.\\\\n+- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limits and constraints\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.\\\\n+\\\\n+- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.\\\\n+- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.\\\\n+- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.\\\\n+- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.\\\\n+- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name (neutral branding).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a new theme\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

This allows for unique sign-in experiences per application, overriding the default tenant-wide branding. The existing `how-to-customize-branding-customers.md` document has been updated to link to this new resource, and the table of contents (`toc.yml`) has been modified to include the new document under the \"Customize branding\" section for external identities.",

Each application can have its own theme that you can customize with a background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. This customization overrides any configurations made to the default branding. If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements are displayed.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article describes how you can create multiple branding themes for different applications in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Have at least the [Organizational Branding Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator) role.\\\\n+- Have at least the [Application Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role for applications that you want to apply a theme to.\\\\n+- A registered application in your tenant. If you haven't registered an application yet, see [Register an application](../../identity-platform/quickstart-register-app.md).\\\\n+- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Branding theme properties\\\\n+\\\\n+When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the sign-in page, with each of the default branding elements highlighted.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+| Property | Description |\\\\n+| --- | --- |\\\\n+| Favicon | Small icon that appears on the left side of the browser tab. |\\\\n+| Header | Space across the top of the sign-in page, behind the header log. |\\\\n+| Header logo | Logo that appears in the upper-left corner of the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Background image | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Page background color | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Banner logo | Logo that appears at the top of the sign-in box |\\\\n+| Sign-in page title | Larger text that appears below the banner logo. |\\\\n+| Sign-in page description | Text to describe the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Username hint and text | The text that appears before a user enters their information. |\\\\n+| Sign-in display message box | Text you can add below the username field. |\\\\n+| Footer link: Privacy & Cookies | Link you can add to the lower-right corner for privacy information. |\\\\n+| Footer: Terms of Use | Text in the lower-right corner of the page where you can add Terms of use information. |\\\\n+| Footer | Space across the bottom of the page for privacy and Terms of Use information. |\\\\n+| Template | The layout of the page and sign-in boxes. |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How branding themes work\\\\n+\\\\n+Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.\\\\n+- **Default branding (company branding)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.\\\\n+- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.\\\\n+- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.\\\\n+- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limits and constraints\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.\\\\n+\\\\n+- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.\\\\n+- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.\\\\n+- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.\\\\n+- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.\\\\n+- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name (neutral branding).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a new theme\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

      "Response": "A new document, `how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps.md`, has been added, detailing how to create and apply custom branding themes to individual applications within Microsoft External ID for external tenants. This new article introduces the concept of branding themes as a way to provide unique sign-in experiences for different applications, complementing the existing tenant-wide default branding.\n\nThe `how-to-customize-branding-customers.md` file has been updated to include a link to this new article in its \"Related content\" section. Additionally, the `toc.yml` file for the `external-id/customers` directory has been modified to include the new \"Branding themes\" section and link to the `how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps.md` article. Several image files related to the new branding themes documentation have also been added.",

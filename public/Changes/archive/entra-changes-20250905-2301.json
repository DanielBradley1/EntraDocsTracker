In this policy, Microsoft Entra Internet Access blocks traffic based on domain and URL indicators from both Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence providers. With the threat intelligence rule engine, you can also configure allow lists for handling false positives. All of these policies can become context-aware with the Security Profile framework, linking Global Secure Access (GSA) security policies to Conditional Access. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Administrators who interact with **Global Secure Access** features must have one or more of the following role assignments depending on the tasks they're performing.\\\\n+   - The [Global Secure Access Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) role to manage the Global Secure Access features.\\\\n+   - The [Conditional Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#conditional-access-administrator) to create and interact with Conditional Access policies.\\\\n+- Complete the [Get started with Global Secure Access](how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access.md) guide.\\\\n+- [Install the Global Secure Access client](how-to-install-windows-client.md) on end user devices.\\\\n+- You must disable Domain Name System (DNS) over HTTPS (Secure DNS) to tunnel network traffic. Use the rules of the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) in the traffic forwarding profile. For more information, see [Configure the DNS client to support DoH](/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support#configure-the-dns-client-to-support-doh).\\\\n+- Disable built-in DNS client on Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\\\\n+- IPv6 traffic isn't acquired by the client and is therefore transferred directly to the network. To enable all relevant traffic to be tunneled, set the network adapter properties to [IPv4 preferred](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check.md#ipv4-preferred).\\\\n+- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic (that is, QUIC) isn't supported in the current preview of Internet Access. Most websites support fallback to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) when QUIC can't be established. For an improved user experience, you can deploy a Windows Firewall rule that blocks outbound UDP 443: \\\\n+\\\\n+```powershell \\\\n+@New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Block QUIC\\\\\\\" -Direction Outbound -Action Block -Protocol UDP  -RemotePort 443\\\\n+``` \\\\n+\\\\n+- (Optional) [Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection](how-to-transport-layer-security.md) in order for URL indicators to be evaluated against HTTPS traffic.\\\\n+\\\\n+## High level steps\\\\n+\\\\n+There are several steps to configuring threat intelligence. Take note of where you need to configure a Conditional Access policy.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. [Enable internet traffic forwarding.](#enable-internet-traffic-forwarding)\\\\n+1. [Create a threat intelligence policy.](#create-a-threat-intelligence-policy)\\\\n+1. [Configure your allow list (optional).](#configure-your-allow-list-optional)\\\\n+1. [Create a security profile.](#create-a-security-profile-or-configure-the-baseline-profile)\\\\n+1. [Link the security profile to a Conditional Access policy.](#create-and-link-conditional-access-policy)\\\\n+\\\\n+## Enable internet traffic forwarding\\\\n+\\\\n+The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile. To learn more about the profile and how to enable it, see [How to manage the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile](how-to-manage-internet-access-profile.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+You can scope the Internet Access profile to specific users and groups. To learn more about user and group assignment, see [How to assign and manage users and groups with traffic forwarding profiles](how-to-manage-users-groups-assignment.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a threat intelligence policy\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**.\\\\n+1. Select **Create policy**.\\\\n+1. Enter a name and description for the policy and select **Next**.\\\\n+1. The default action for threat intelligence is \\\\\\\"Allow\\\\\\\". This means that if traffic doesn't match a rule in the threat intelligence policy, the policy engine will allow the traffic to go to the next security control.\\\\n+1. Select **Next** and **Review** your new threat intelligence policy.\\\\n+1. Select **Create**\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> This policy is created with a rule blocking access to destinations where high severity threats are detected. Microsoft defines high severity threats as domains or URLs associated with active malware distribution, phishing campaigns, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and other threads, identified by Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence feeds with high confidence.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Configure your allow list (optional)\\\\n+\\\\n+If you're aware of sites that may be business-critical or are labeled as false positives, you can configure rules that allow these sites. Note the security risks involved with this action, as the internet threat landscape is ever-changing.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**, select your chosen threat intelligence policy.\\\\n+1. Select **Rules**.\\\\n+1. Select **Add rule**.\\\\n+1. Enter a name, description, priority, and status for the rule.\\\\n+1. Edit **Destination FQDNs** and select the list of domains for your allow list. You can enter these FQDNs as comma-separated domains.\\\\n+1. Select **Add**. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a security profile or configure the baseline profile\\\\n+\\\\n+Security profiles are a grouping of security controls like web content filtering and threat intelligence policies. You can assign, or link, security profiles with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies. One security profile can contain a policy of each type.\\\\n+\\\\n+In this step, you create a security profile to group filtering policies like web content filtering and/or threat intelligence. Then you assign, or link, the security profiles with a Conditional Access policy to make them user or context aware.\\\\n+\\\\n+Since threat intelligence is critical for users' basic security posture, you can alternatively link your threat intelligence policy to the baseline security profile, which applies policy to all users' traffic in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> You can only configure threat intelligence policy per security profile. Rule priorities within each security control handle exceptions, and security controls follow the ordering, (1) TLS inspection > (2) Web content filtering > (3) Threat intelligence > (4) File type > (6) Data loss prevention > (7) Third-party\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Security profiles**.\\\\n+2. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n+3. Enter a name and description for the profile and select **Next**.\\\\n+4. Select **Link a policy** and then select **Existing threat intelligence policy**.\\\\n+5. Select the threat intelligence policy you already created and select **Add**.\\\\n+6. Select **Next** to review the security profile and associated policy.\\\\n+7. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n+8. Select **Refresh** to view the new profile.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create and link Conditional Access policy\\\\n+\\\\n+Create a Conditional Access policy for end users or groups and deliver your security profile through Conditional Access Session controls. Conditional Access is the delivery mechanism for user and context awareness for Internet Access policies.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Identity** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.\\\\n+2. Select **Create new policy**.\\\\n+3. Enter a name and assign a user or group.\\\\n+4. Select **Target resources** and **All internet resources with Global Secure Access**.\\\\n+5. Select **Session** > **Use Global Secure Access security profile** and choose a security profile.\\\\n+6. Select **Select**.\\\\n+7. In the **Enable policy** section, ensure **On** is selected.\\\\n+8. Select **Create**.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Applying a new security profile can take up to 60-90 minutes because security profiles are enforced via access tokens.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Verify end user policy enforcement\\\\n+\\\\n+Use a Windows device with the Global Secure Access client installed. Sign in as a user that is assigned the Internet traffic acquisition profile. Test that navigating to malicious websites is blocked as expected.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> After configuring a threat intelligence policy, you may need to [clear your browser's cache](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/learning-center/how-to-manage-and-clear-your-cache-and-cookies) to validate policy enforcement.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Right-click on the Global Secure Access client icon in the task manager tray and open **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Forwarding profile**. Ensure that the Internet access acquisition rules are present.\\\\n+1. Navigate to a known malicious site (for example, `entratestthreat.com` or `smartscreentestratings2.net`). Ensure that you're blocked and that the Threat Type field is nonempty in the traffic logs. Traffic logs may take up to 5 minutes to appear in the portal.\\\\n+1. If blocked by Windows Defender or Smart screen, override and access the site to test the Global Secure Access block message. You can do this by choosing \\\\\\\"Continue to the unsafe site (not recommended)\\\\\\\" under \\\\\\\"More information.\\\\\\\"\\\\n+1. To test allow-listing, create a rule in the Threat Intelligence policy to allow access to the site. Within 2 minutes, you should be able to access it. (You may need to clear your browser cache.)\\\\n+1. Evaluate the rest of the threat feed against your known threat indicators.\\\\n+\\\\n+![Screenshot showing a plaintext browser error for unencrypted or TLS inspected HTTP traffic.](media/how-to-configure-threat-intelligence/http-block-threat-intelligence.png)\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!CAUTION]\\\\n+> Testing with real malicious sites should be performed in a sandbox or test environment to protect your device and enterprise.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Next steps\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Learn about the traffic dashboard](concept-traffic-dashboard.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"6865a34871430bd6b0f12a343c08246ea81ec041\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 3,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 4,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/d149416f34269b110dc9d461e3589f2a243d67b8/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/d149416f34269b110dc9d461e3589f2a243d67b8/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md?ref=d149416f34269b110dc9d461e3589f2a243d67b8\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -57,8 +57,6 @@ The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile.

It extends traditional Kerberos capabilities into the Microsoft Entra ecosystem, allowing organizations to modernize their identity infrastructure without sacrificing compatibility with legacy systems. It also enables seamless single sign-on (SSO) to on-premises resources for users authenticated with modern credentials like Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys.\\\\n+\\\\n+In practice, Microsoft Entra Kerberos turns Microsoft Entra ID into a cloud-based Key Distribution Center (KDC) for Kerberos authentication. This capability allows Microsoft Entra ID to issue Kerberos tickets for users, extending traditional Kerberos authentication beyond on-premises Active Directory. Microsoft Entra Kerberos was introduced in 2021 to help bridge the gap between legacy, on-premises authentication protocols, and modern cloud identity.\\\\n+\\\\n+In a hybrid scenario, where accounts exist on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and those users are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Kerberos plays a crucial role. It enables these hybrid users to authenticate to cloud and on-premises resources using Kerberos without needing direct line of sight to domain controllers. For example, if a Microsoft Entra ID–joined Windows client accesses a file share or application over the internet, Microsoft Entra ID can issue the necessary Kerberos tickets on behalf of the on-premises Active Directory environment.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> For more information about Kerberos in Windows, see [Kerberos authentication overview](/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Hybrid Identity \\\\n+\\\\n+A hybrid identity refers to a user identity that exists both in an on-premises Active Directory (AD DS) and in Microsoft Entra ID. These identities are synchronized using tools like Microsoft Entra Connect, allowing users to access both cloud-based and on-premises resources with a single set of credentials. This setup enables seamless authentication and single sign-on (SSO) experiences across environments. It is ideal for organizations transitioning to the cloud while maintaining legacy infrastructure. \\\\n+\\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> Currently, Microsoft Entra Kerberos only works with hybrid identities.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Key features and benefits\\\\n+\\\\n+**Seamless Hybrid authentication**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos allows users whose accounts reside in on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate across cloud and on-premises resources. It reduces and in some cases eliminates the need for direct connectivity to domain controllers. For example, when a Microsoft Entra ID-joined Windows client accesses a file share or application over the internet, Entra ID can issue the necessary Kerberos tickets as a KDC associated with the resource.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Enhanced security with modern credentials support**: Users can sign in using passwordless methods such as Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys yet still access on-premises resources protected by Kerberos. Enables multifactor and password-less authentication, reducing risks associated with password theft and phishing attacks.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Simplified Hybrid join**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos supports hybrid join scenarios without requiring ADFS or Microsoft Entra Connect sync. This is ideal for non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), disconnected forests, and Azure Virtual Desktop.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Secure ticket exchange**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos uses a secure Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) exchange model.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Scalable group memberships**: Addresses traditional Kerberos limitations with large or dynamic group memberships, improving reliability and user experience. In scenarios involving large groups of users, performance is optimized through automatic load distribution across all domain controllers (DCs) within a site. For deployments in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments, we recommend ensuring that sufficient DCs are available and geographically close to the environment to maintain responsiveness.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## How Microsoft Entra Kerberos works\\\\n+\\\\n+**Microsoft Entra Kerberos** allows your Microsoft Entra ID tenant to operate as a dedicated Kerberos realm alongside your existing on-premises Active Directory realm. When a user signs in to a Windows device that is either Microsoft Entra ID‑joined or hybrid joined, the device authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID and receives a [Primary Refresh Token](../devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+In addition to the PRT, Entra ID can issue a partial Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This TGT enables the user to exchange it for a fully formed on‑premises TGT when needed, and it can also issue a Cloud Ticket Granting Ticket (Cloud TGT) which enables the user to request Kerberos service tickets for accessing cloud‑based resources. In this model, Microsoft Entra ID acts as the Key Distribution Center (KDC), facilitating secure and seamless authentication.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Authentication flow\\\\n+\\\\n+### User authentication:\\\\n+- The user signs into a Windows device (Windows 10 2004+ or Windows 11).\\\\n+- The Local Security Authority (LSA) uses the Cloud Authentication Provider (CloudAP) to authenticate via OAuth to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID issues a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) containing user and device information.\\\\n+- The TGT is for the realm KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM, which acts as a cloud-based Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC).\\\\n+\\\\n+### Cloud TGT issuance:\\\\n+- If the user signs in with a passwordless method (such as FIDO2 or Windows Hello for Business), Microsoft Entra ID issues a Partial Ticket Granting Ticket (Partial TGT) for the user's on-premises Active Directory (AD) domain. This Partial TGT contains the user's Security Identifier (SID) but no authorization data.\\\\n+\\\\n+- A Kerberos server object exists in the on-premises AD, created and synchronized via Microsoft Entra Connect. This object allows Microsoft Entra ID to generate these partial TGTs for use by on-premises domain controllers to facilitate on-premises resource access.\\\\n+\\\\n+- The Partial TGT issued by Entra ID is exchanged with an on-premises Active Directory domain controller to obtain a full TGT that includes group memberships and other access control data. The Partial TGT must be exchanged with a domain controller to gain full authorization information.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID also acts as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for cloud resources, issuing a Cloud Ticket Granting Ticket (Cloud TGT) to the client when appropriate. The Cloud TGT is stored in the client's Kerberos ticket cache, and the client recognizes the Microsoft Entra ID tenant as a separate Kerberos realm for cloud resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Microsoft Entra Kerberos TGT and Active Directory access control\\\\n+Possessing an Microsoft Entra Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for a user's on-premises Active Directory (AD) domain does not automatically grant access to a full AD TGT. To complete the exchange, the user must be listed in the reveal credentials allowlist on the Azure AD Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) object and not in the blocklist. As a best practice, the default configuration should be set to Deny, with explicit Allow permissions granted only to groups authorized to use Microsoft Entra Kerberos.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/kerberos/kerberos-account.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of a user account properties in Active Directory.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/kerberos/kerberos-account.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+    \\\\n+During the exchange process, where a partial Microsoft Entra Kerberos TGT is converted into a full AD TGT these lists are evaluated to determine access eligibility. If a user is blocked or not explicitly allowed, the request is denied and results in an error.\\\\n+\\\\n+    \\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> The TGT is only recognized by on-premises Active Directory. Therefore, having access to a partial TGT doesn't provide access to other resources outside of AD.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Cloud TGT for cloud resources:\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID acts as a Key Distribution Center (KDC under the realm KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM issuing a Cloud Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the client.\\\\n+- The client recognizes the Microsoft Entra ID tenant as a separate Kerberos realm for cloud resources and the TGT is stored in the client's Kerberos ticket cache.\\\\n+- The cloud TGT contains authorization data only specific to cloud services and is sufficient for accessing resources integrated with Microsoft Entra Kerberos, such as Azure Files and Azure SQL.\\\\n+\\\\n+>[!NOTE]\\\\n+> The Cloud TGT isn't a replacement for the on-premises TGT. It's another ticket that allows access to cloud resources. The on-premises TGT is still required for accessing on-premises resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Realm mapping and Azure tenant info:\\\\n+- Windows LSASS manages the Kerberos Cloud TGT, realm mapping, and Entra ID tenant information. The Kerberos stack maintains the Cloud TGT and realm mapping, using a KDC Proxy to route Kerberos traffic to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- For Azure Virtual Desktop, the user receives both a PRT and Cloud TGT. Azure Virtual Desktop uses FSLogix to load the user profile from Azure Files.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Service ticket request and issuance:\\\\n+\\\\n+**Access on-premises resources**:\\\\n+- Entra ID issues a partial TGT.\\\\n+- The client contacts an on-premises AD domain controller to exchange it for a full TGT.\\\\n+- This full TGT is then used to access on-premises resources like SMB shares or SQL servers.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Access cloud resources**:\\\\n+The client uses cloud TGT to request service tickets for cloud resources. No interaction with on-premises AD is needed.\\\\n+- When the user accesses a service (for example, Azure Files), the client requests a service ticket from Microsoft Entra ID by presenting the TGT.\\\\n+- The client sends a Ticket Granting Service Request (TGS-REQ) to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- Kerberos identifies the service (for example, cifs/mystuff.file.core.windows.net) and maps the domain to KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM. The KDC Proxy protocol enables Kerberos communication over the internet.\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID verifies the Cloud TGT and the user's identity and looks up the requested Service Principal Name (SPN) for the Azure Files resource registered in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- Generates a service ticket and encrypts it using the service principal's key and returns the ticket to the client in a TGS-REP.\\\\n+- The Kerberos stack processes the TGS-REP, extracts the ticket, and generates an Application Request (AP-REQ).\\\\n+- The AP-REQ is provided to SMB, which includes it in the request to Azure Files.\\\\n+- Azure Files decrypts the ticket and grants access. FSLogix can now read the user profile from Azure Files and load the Azure Virtual Desktop session.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Summary\\\\n+\\\\n+| Feature | Cloud TGT | On-premises TGT |\\\\n+|---|---|---|\\\\n+| Issuer | Entra ID | On-premises AD (via exchange) |\\\\n+| Realm | KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM | On-premises AD domain |\\\\n+| Authorization data | Cloud-specific | Full AD group memberships |\\\\n+| Exchange required | No | Yes (partial → full TGT) |\\\\n+| Use case | Azure Files, Azure SQL | SMB shares, legacy apps |\\\\n+| Verification tool (macOS) | tgt_cloud | tgt_ad |\\\\n+| Verification tool (Windows) | klist cloud_debug | klist get krbtgt |\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Scenarios\\\\n+\\\\n+### Windows authentication access to Azure SQL managed instance using Microsoft Entra Kerberos\\\\n+Kerberos authentication for Microsoft Entra ID enables Windows Authentication access to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

The default cap is 1,010 groups per ticket. If exceeded, only the first 1010 are included, which can cause access failures for users in large organizations.\\\\n+### MFA incompatibility for Azure files authentication\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra Kerberos authentication for Azure file shares doesn't support multifactor authentication (MFA).\\\\n+- Conditional Access policies enforcing MFA must exclude the storage account application or users experience authentication failures.\\\\n+- Exclude Azure Files from Conditional Access policies that require MFA. This can be done by scoping the policy to exclude the storage account or the specific application accessing Azure Files.\\\\n+### Attribute synchronization requirements\\\\n+- Proper synchronization of key on-premises AD user attributes is essential for Microsoft Entra Kerberos to work, including onPremisesDomainName, onPremisesUserPrincipalName, and onPremisesSamAccountName.\\\\n+### Single AD method per Azure Storage account\\\\n+- For Azure Files identity-based authentication, only one AD method (Microsoft Entra Kerberos, on-premises AD DS, or Microsoft Entra Domain Services) can be enabled per storage account at a time.\\\\n+- Switching between methods requires disabling the current method first.\\\\n+### Kerberos encryption settings\\\\n+- Kerberos ticket encryption with Microsoft Entra Kerberos uses AES-256 exclusively. SMB channel encryption can be configured separately based on requirements.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Getting started with Microsoft Entra Kerberos\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Set Up Microsoft Entra Connect**:\\\\n+    - Synchronize on-premises AD DS users to Microsoft Entra ID.

When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. Unused connectors are tagged as `_inactive_` and are removed after 10 days of inactivity. If you do want to uninstall a connector, though, uninstall both the Connector service and the Updater service from the server. Restart the computer to fully remove the service.\\\\n \\\\n+## Handling Connector Server Issues\\\\n+If one or more connector servers become unavailable (e.g., due to a server outage, network outage, or similar issue), follow these steps to maintain service continuity:\\\\n+ \\\\n+1.\\\\tIdentify and remove the affected (“bad”) servers from the connector group.\\\\n+2.\\\\tAdd available healthy servers (“good”) or backup servers into the connector group to restore capacity.\\\\n+3.\\\\tReboot affected servers to drain any pre-existing connections.

As long as the private network connector updater service is running, your connectors may update with the latest major connector release automatically.

      "Response": "This commit introduces several updates to Microsoft Entra documentation. New guidance on handling connector server issues is added to the concept connectors documentation. The FAQ for transport layer security now specifies supported cryptographic algorithms. The minimum Windows Server version for the Entra private network connector has been updated to 2016. Finally, new documentation has been added regarding the configuration of requestor visibility of approver details in the My Access portal for entitlement management.",

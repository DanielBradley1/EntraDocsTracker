Universal CAE protects the GSA access tokens from theft and replay. Universal CAE revokes and revalidates network access in near real-time whenever Entra ID detects changes to the identity. Traditional Entra ID CAE requires each workload to adopt special libraries and is limited to first-party applications only. Universal CAE extends benefits of CAE to any application accessed with Global Secure Access, without requiring the application to be CAE aware.\\\\n \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"9948c903854ab230b9d62a439068ed6da06f7d3e\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/id-governance/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-guest-users.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 40,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 7,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 47,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/896075136eb33132522d58e17fadb94288b5d21e/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fmicrosoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-guest-users.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/896075136eb33132522d58e17fadb94288b5d21e/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fmicrosoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-guest-users.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fmicrosoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-guest-users.md?ref=896075136eb33132522d58e17fadb94288b5d21e\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,7 +6,7 @@ manager: dougeby\\\\n ms.service: entra-id-governance\\\\n ms.subservice: entitlement-management\\\\n ms.topic: reference\\\\n-ms.date: 09/22/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 11/03/2025\\\\n ms.author: owinfrey\\\\n ms.reviewer: jercon\\\\n ---\\\\n@@ -17,13 +17,13 @@ This article outlines the pricing structure for Microsoft Entra ID Governance fo\\\\n \\\\n ## Monthly active users (MAU) billing model\\\\n \\\\n-Microsoft Entra ID Governance utilizes Monthly Active User (MAU) licensing for guest users which is different than licensing for employees.

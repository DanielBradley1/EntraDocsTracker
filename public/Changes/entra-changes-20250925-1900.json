You want to keep as much traffic within a specific datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. You deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the applications that reside within the datacenter. This approach minimizes cross-datacenter links and provides an entirely transparent experience to your users.\\\\n+Large organizations use multiple datacenters.

This approach reduces cross-datacenter traffic and is transparent to users.\\\\n \\\\n ### Applications installed on isolated networks\\\\n \\\\n-Applications can be hosted in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. You can use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks to also isolate applications to the network. The scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific application.\\\\n+Apps run in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. Use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks and keep those apps contained there. This scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific app.\\\\n \\\\n-### Applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\\\n+### Applications installed on infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\\\\n \\\\n-For applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud access, connector groups provide a common service to secure access to all apps. Connector groups don't create more dependencies on your corporate network, or fragment the app experience. Connectors are installed on every cloud datacenter and serve only applications that reside in that network. You install several connectors to achieve high availability.\\\\n+For apps on infrastructure as a service (IaaS), use connector groups to secure access to all apps without adding corporate network dependencies or fragmenting the experience. Install connectors in each cloud datacenter and scope them to apps in that network. Install multiple connectors for high availability.\\\\n \\\\n-Take as an example an organization that has several virtual machines connected to their own IaaS hosted virtual network. To allow employees to use these applications, these private networks are connected to the corporate network using site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Site-to-site VPN provides a good experience for employees that are located on-premises. But, it isn't ideal for remote employees, because it requires more on-premises infrastructure to route access, as illustrated in the diagram:\\\\n+For example, an organization has several virtual machines connected to its own IaaS-hosted virtual network.

The connector’s machines are joined to a domain that can delegate the users to the application. KCD supports cross-forest capabilities. But for companies who have distinct multi-forest environments with no trust between them, a single connector can't be used for all forests. Instead, specific connectors are deployed per forest, and set to serve applications that are published to serve only the users of that specific forest. Each connector group represents a different forest. While the tenant and most of the experience is unified for all forests, users can be assigned to their forest applications using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n+Single sign-on often uses Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).

The site also has the same networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. You can create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers for you.\\\\n-* Your DR site is separate from the main site. You create a different connector group in the DR site. You either have backup applications, or manually divert existing application to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n+* Your DR site runs in active-active mode and matches the main site networking and Active Directory (AD) settings.

Create a different connector group there. Use backup apps or manually divert existing apps to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n \\\\n ### Serve multiple companies from a single tenant\\\\n \\\\n-You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies. Connector groups help you segregate the connectors and applications into different groups. One way, which is suitable for small companies, is to have a single Microsoft Entra tenant while the different companies have their own domain name and networks. The same approach works for merger scenarios and situations where a single division serves several companies for regulatory or business reasons.\\\\n+You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies.

All applications are served using customized connector groups.\\\\n+For large, complex organizations, set the default connector group to hold idle or newly installed connectors. Don’t assign applications to it.

These versions contain a back-end service change that hardens our services and readies Connect Sync for the [MSOnline PowerShell retirement](https://aka.ms/msonlineretirement) in April 2025. **All customers are required to upgrade** to the [minimum versions](#minimum-versions) by **April 30, 2025**.\\\\n \\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n->**All customers are required to upgrade** to the [minimum versions](#minimum-versions) by **April 30, 2025**.\\\\n+#customer intent: As an IT admin, I want to know the minimum version requirements for Microsoft Entra Connect Sync so that I can ensure compliance.\\\\n+---\\\\n+# Hardening update to Microsoft Entra Connect Sync\\\\n \\\\n-The deadline has been extended by three weeks from the earlier communicated date of April 7, 2025.\\\\n+As part of increasing the security posture of Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft deployed a dedicated first-party application to enable the synchronization between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. This new application will manifest as a first party service principal called the \\\\\\\"Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service\\\\\\\" (Application Id: `6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016`) and will be visible in the Enterprise Applications experience within the Microsoft Entra admin center. This application is critical for the continued operation of on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID synchronization functionality through Entra Connect.\\\\n \\\\n+We have since released a new version (2.5.79.0) of Microsoft Entra Connect that contains this service change.  All customers are required to upgrade to the minimum versions by September 30, 2026 to avoid service disruptions.\\\\n \\\\n ## Expected impacts \\\\n \\\\n-Though the deadline has been extended, if you are not yet on a minimum supported version, you'll experience the following impacts after the original date:\\\\n-\\\\n-- After April 7, 2025, configuration of Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) scenarios through Microsoft Entra Connect wizard won't work.\\\\n- - After April 7, 2025, configuration of PingFederate scenarios through the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard won't work.\\\\n- - After April 30, 2025, all authentication requests to Microsoft Entra ID on the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard will fail.

Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is the new sync client that works from the cloud and allows customers to set up and manage their sync preferences online. We recommend that you use Cloud Sync because we're introducing new features that improve the sync experiences through Cloud Sync. You can avoid future migrations by choosing Cloud Sync if that's the right option for you. Use the https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions to see if Cloud Sync is the right sync client for you. \\\\n \\\\n-See the video below to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.\\\\n+See the following video to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.\\\\n \\\\n > [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/9T6lKEloq0Q]\\\\n \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"42407c4d30124f95d445e8d9277ebcef08150eed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 6,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 7,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md?ref=3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -8,13 +8,18 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.tgt_pltfrm: na\\\\n ms.custom: no-azure-ad-ps-ref, sfi-ga-nochange\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 08/28/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 09/17/2025\\\\n ms.subservice: hybrid-connect\\\\n ms.author: jomondi\\\\n ---\\\\n # Prerequisites for Microsoft Entra Connect\\\\n This article describes the prerequisites and the hardware requirements for Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n \\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+>**Mandatory Upgrade Required**: All synchronization services in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync will stop working on **September 30, 2026** if you're not on at least version 2.5.79.0.

You want to keep as much traffic within a specific datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. You deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the applications that reside within the datacenter. This approach minimizes cross-datacenter links and provides an entirely transparent experience to your users.\\\\n+Large organizations use multiple datacenters.

This approach reduces cross-datacenter traffic and is transparent to users.\\\\n \\\\n ### Applications installed on isolated networks\\\\n \\\\n-Applications can be hosted in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. You can use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks to also isolate applications to the network. The scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific application.\\\\n+Apps run in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. Use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks and keep those apps contained there. This scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific app.\\\\n \\\\n-### Applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\\\n+### Applications installed on infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\\\\n \\\\n-For applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud access, connector groups provide a common service to secure access to all apps. Connector groups don't create more dependencies on your corporate network, or fragment the app experience. Connectors are installed on every cloud datacenter and serve only applications that reside in that network. You install several connectors to achieve high availability.\\\\n+For apps on infrastructure as a service (IaaS), use connector groups to secure access to all apps without adding corporate network dependencies or fragmenting the experience. Install connectors in each cloud datacenter and scope them to apps in that network. Install multiple connectors for high availability.\\\\n \\\\n-Take as an example an organization that has several virtual machines connected to their own IaaS hosted virtual network. To allow employees to use these applications, these private networks are connected to the corporate network using site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Site-to-site VPN provides a good experience for employees that are located on-premises. But, it isn't ideal for remote employees, because it requires more on-premises infrastructure to route access, as illustrated in the diagram:\\\\n+For example, an organization has several virtual machines connected to its own IaaS-hosted virtual network.

The connector’s machines are joined to a domain that can delegate the users to the application. KCD supports cross-forest capabilities. But for companies who have distinct multi-forest environments with no trust between them, a single connector can't be used for all forests. Instead, specific connectors are deployed per forest, and set to serve applications that are published to serve only the users of that specific forest. Each connector group represents a different forest. While the tenant and most of the experience is unified for all forests, users can be assigned to their forest applications using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n+Single sign-on often uses Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).

The tenant and most of the experience are unified, and you assign users to their forest apps by using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n \\\\n-### Disaster Recovery sites\\\\n+### Disaster recovery sites\\\\n \\\\n There are two approaches to consider for disaster recovery (DR) sites:\\\\n \\\\n-* Your DR site is built in active-active mode where it's exactly like the main site. The site also has the same networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. You can create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers for you.\\\\n-* Your DR site is separate from the main site. You create a different connector group in the DR site. You either have backup applications, or manually divert existing application to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n+* Your DR site runs in active-active mode and matches the main site networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. Create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers.\\\\n+* Your DR site is separate from the main site. Create a different connector group there. Use backup apps or manually divert existing apps to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n \\\\n ### Serve multiple companies from a single tenant\\\\n \\\\n-You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies. Connector groups help you segregate the connectors and applications into different groups. One way, which is suitable for small companies, is to have a single Microsoft Entra tenant while the different companies have their own domain name and networks. The same approach works for merger scenarios and situations where a single division serves several companies for regulatory or business reasons.\\\\n+You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies.

All applications are served using customized connector groups.\\\\n+For large, complex organizations, set the default connector group to hold idle or newly installed connectors. Don’t assign applications to it. Serve all applications through custom connector groups.\\\\n \\\\n-In the example, the company has two datacenters, A, and B, with two connectors that serve each site. Each site has different applications that run on it.\\\\n+In this example, the company has two datacenters (A and B). Two connectors serve each site.

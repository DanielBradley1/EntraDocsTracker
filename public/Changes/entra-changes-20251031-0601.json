There are many default attributes that you can use to trigger workflows, but sometimes you might require triggering a workflow based on a specific attribute not offered by default. Using custom attribute triggers, you can trigger a workflow to run for users based on when they move within your organization based on:\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Custom security attributes (CSA)](manage-workflow-custom-security-attribute.md)\\\\n+- Directory extension attributes\\\\n+- On-premises extension attributes (1-15)\\\\n+- EmployeeOrgData attributes\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Entra ID Governance license](../includes/entra-entra-governance-license.md)]\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Use custom attribute triggers in a new workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center\\\\n+\\\\n+To use custom attribute triggers in a new workflow, do the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Once Lifecycle Workflows starts checking for attribute changes, the time it takes for changes to be picked up might be delayed for these custom attributes. While changes should be picked up within minutes, there are upstream processes that will add further delays after the user attribute changes, for example:\\\\n+- Custom attributes might take up to 4 hours for their changes to be updated by the underlying service, however, once the custom attributes changes are propagated, Lifecycle Workflows should pick up the change within seconds.\\\\n+- Once changes are picked up by Lifecycle workflows, workflow execution will occur in the next target run, according to the schedule for users that meet the workflow scope.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Attribute vs custom attribute processing timing\\\\n+\\\\n+The following image shows the potential differences in processing times for using regular attributes and custom attributes in the workflow trigger. \\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/workflow-custom-triggers/custom-attribute-timing.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of a comparison between regular and custom attribute processing timing in a workflow run.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+In example A, The workflow is scheduled to run when the department attribute changes, it's 12:00 pm and the next target runs are at 1pm and 2pm:\\\\n+- At 12:10pm, the user department changes\\\\n+- At 12:15 pm, the user is detected to be in scope of the workflow\\\\n+- In the 1pm run, the user gets processed by the workflow\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+In example B, Workflow is scheduled to run when the TestCustomSecurityAttribute1 attribute changes, it's 12:00 pm and the next target runs are at 1pm and 2pm:\\\\n+- At 12:10pm the TestCustomSecurityAttribute1 attribute changes for a user\\\\n+- At 3:55 pm the change is passed to Lifecycle Workflows\\\\n+- At 4:00 pm the user is detected to be in scope of the workflow (too late for the 4pm run)\\\\n+- In the 5pm run, the user gets processed by the workflow\\\\n+\\\\n+For frequently asked question about using custom attribute triggers within lifecycle workflows, see: [Lifecycle workflows FAQs](workflows-faqs.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Next step\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Lifecycle workflows execution conditions and scheduling](lifecycle-workflow-execution-conditions.md)\\\\n+- [Custom security attributes (CSA)](manage-workflow-custom-security-attribute.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"0e5988f299227186b01c36ae34054bdf60cf157b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/id-governance/workflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md?ref=03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -58,6 +58,23 @@ Lifecycle workflows checks that the user is assigned the custom security attribu\\\\n \\\\n If a user is assigned a custom security attribute that has multiple values, and one of the values matches the value in the specified in rule expressions, the user matches the scope.\\\\n \\\\n+### Why canâ€™t I see the custom attributes listed in the attributes change trigger?\\\\n+\\\\n+To see the expected attributes in the drop down list, you need to ensure the following:\\\\n+\\\\n+- The attributes must be configured and active\\\\n+- For custom security attributes, you have the appropriate permissions\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Do workflows using custom attribute triggers always take 4 hours to process changes?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, the change processing time can vary depending on tenant change activity, timing and volume, with 4 hours expected to be the upper limit.

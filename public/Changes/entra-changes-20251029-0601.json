    "Response": "This commit updates two documentation files. Firstly, it amends a heading in \"backup-authentication-system.md\" for clarity regarding certificate revocation. Secondly, it adds a clarification to \"how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\" about hardware specifications, specifying that listed requirements are for a combined server and that a remote SQL Server will have its own resource needs.",

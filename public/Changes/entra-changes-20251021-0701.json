      "Response": "This commit updates several documentation files related to Microsoft Entra Connect and Cloud Sync.\n\nKey changes include:\n\n*   **Windows Server 2025 Support:** Both `how-to-prerequisites.md` for Cloud Sync and `how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md` for Entra Connect now explicitly state that Windows Server 2025 is *not* supported due to a known issue with a specific update (KB5065426). A registry workaround is provided for affected users, and official support is noted as planned for a future release.\n*   **Group Filtering in Entra Connect:** The documentation for configuring group claims in Entra Connect (`how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md`) now clarifies limitations for group filtering, stating that it only applies if a user belongs to 1,000 or fewer groups, otherwise an overage claim is sent. This information has also been integrated into the general service limits document (`entra-service-limits-include.md`).\n*   **Minor Tweaks:** Some minor formatting and wording adjustments have been made across the files.",

This means when the workflow engine evaluates users that meet the current execution conditions for the scheduled workflow, it includes users for whom the expected trigger date has already passed but wasn't more than three days past the original trigger date. Once the user is processed, it would only be considered again if there was a change for the user or workflows that allowed it to meet the execution conditions again.\\\\n+\\\\n+The following table shows examples of Lifecycle workflow's catch up window:\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+|Workflow Scenario  |User Data  |Lifecycle workflow behavior  |\\\\n+|---------|---------|---------|\\\\n+|A [pre-hire template](lifecycle-workflow-templates.md#onboard-pre-hire-employee) workflow is scheduled to run for users 7 days before their **EmployeeHireDate**.    |  A user is provisioned by HR in Microsoft Entra ID with an **EmployeeHireDate** in 10 days.      |  The workflow runs for the new user as the date is before the offset.      |\\\\n+|A [pre-hire template](lifecycle-workflow-templates.md#onboard-pre-hire-employee) workflow is scheduled to run for users 7 days before their **EmployeeHireDate**.    | A new user is provisioned by HR in Microsoft Entra ID with an **EmployeeHireDate** in 5 days.      |  The workflow runs for the new user as the date is within 3 days of the offset.      |\\\\n+|A [pre-hire template](lifecycle-workflow-templates.md#onboard-pre-hire-employee) workflow is scheduled to run for users 7 days before their **EmployeeHireDate**.    |  A new user is provisioned by HR in Microsoft Entra ID with an **EmployeeHireDate** in 3 days.     |  The workflow **does not** run for the new user, as the date is more than 3 days from the offset.      |\\\\n+|A new hire workflow runs on Feb 23 for in scope users with **EmployeeHireDate** of Feb 23.    |  A new user is provisioned by HR in Microsoft Entra ID on Feb 24 with an EmployeeHireDate set as Feb 23.      |  The workflow runs again on Feb 24 for the new user, as the date is within 3 days of the offset.     |\\\\n+\\\\n ## Workflow scheduling\\\\n \\\\n While newly created workflows are enabled by default, scheduling is an option that must be enabled manually.

    "Response": "The documentation for Microsoft Entra ID Lifecycle Workflows has been updated to clarify the behaviour of workflow execution scopes and introduce a detailed explanation of the 'catch-up window'.\n\nOne change updates the `check-workflow-execution-scope.md` file to link to a new section on the catch-up window, replacing a general note about retroactive evaluation.\n\nThe `lifecycle-workflow-execution-conditions.md` file has been significantly updated. It now includes a dedicated section titled \"Lifecycle workflow catch-up window\" which elaborates on the three-day window that allows workflows to run for users whose trigger dates may have recently passed. This section also provides examples to illustrate how this window functions in different scenarios, such as pre-hire and new hire workflows. Additionally, a minor edit was made to the description of the 'Trigger Attribute' in the table.",

The agent analyzes sign-in data and existing policies to define a phased rollout plan. There are three main steps in the phased rollout process.\\\\n+When the Conditional Access optimization agent creates a new policy in report-only mode, it can suggest turning on the policy with a phased rollout. The agent analyzes sign-in data and existing policies to define a phased rollout plan.\\\\n+\\\\n+Policies that are intended to apply to *all users* and need to be turned on are eligible for a phased rollout. Because there are five distinct phases to a rollout plan, you must have at least five groups for the rollout plan to apply. To determine which groups to use, the agent looks at groups that were previously or are currently used in Conditional Access policies. The agent looks at those groups to see how other Conditional Access policies affected them, to gauge potential impact. The agent looks at the size of the groups and then uses all these factors to assign the groups to the phases starting with the low impact groups and ending with the higher-impact groups.\\\\n+\\\\n+There are three steps in the phased rollout process:\\\\n \\\\n-### Agent creates a report-only policy with a phased rollout\\\\n+1. [Agent creates a report-only policy with a phased rollout](#agent-creates-a-report-only-policy-with-a-phased-rollout)\\\\n+1. [Administrator reviews, edits, and accepts the rollout plan](#administrator-reviews-edits-and-accepts-the-rollout-plan)\\\\n+1. [Agent or Administrator executes the approved rollout plan](#agent-or-administrator-executes-the-approved-rollout-plan)\\\\n+\\\\n+You can review the groups included in each phase and the number of days between each phase and make changes before and during the phased rollout. At any time during the rollout, you can choose to have the plan executed by the agent or you can manually execute each phase of the plan.\\\\n+\\\\n+Regardless of how the plan is executed or if you made changes to the plan, when the first phase starts, a *new* policy is created and turned on for the groups included in the first phase. The original report-only mode policy remains intact.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Agent creates a report-only policy with a phased rollout\\\\n \\\\n The agent creates a report-only policy and builds a separate phased rollout plan.

    "Response": "The document updates primarily focus on enhancing clarity and accuracy across several Microsoft Entra documentation pages.\n\nFirstly, changes have been made to the \"Tenant Restrictions v2\" documentation, refining the steps for adding external users and groups.\n\nSecondly, the \"Copilot for Security with Microsoft Entra ID\" documentation has been significantly updated, with a focus on improving the prompts and examples for investigating risky applications and service principals. The date has also been advanced.\n\nThirdly, minor edits have been made to the \"Access Review Agent Logs and Metrics\" and \"Access Review Agent\" documentation, including an image alt-text correction and the addition of language support information for the agent.\n\nFinally, extensive revisions have been made to the \"Conditional Access optimization agent phased rollout\" documentation. This includes removing the \"preview\" label, expanding on the phased rollout process, adding new screenshots, and detailing the automatic and manual execution of rollout plans. Additionally, the \"Conditional Access optimization agent\" documentation has been updated to reflect the removal of the \"preview\" label for chat capabilities, the addition of \"deep analysis\" as a suggestion type, and the inclusion of Intune integration details. Minor adjustments have also been made to the TOC.",

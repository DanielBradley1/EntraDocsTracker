For example, you might be working with another organization and have one point of contact with that organization, but over time more users from that organization will also need access.\\\\n \\\\n With entitlement management, you can define a policy that allows users from organizations you specify to be able to self-request an access package. That policy includes whether approval is required, whether access reviews are required, and an expiration date for the access. In most cases, you want to require approval, in order to have appropriate oversight over which users are brought into your directory. If approval is required, then for major external organization partners, you might consider inviting one or more users from the external organization to your directory, designating them as sponsors, and configuring that sponsors are approvers - since they're likely to know which external users from their organization need access. Once you've configured the access package, obtain the access package's request link so you can send that link to your contact person (sponsor) at the external organization. That contact can share with other users in their external organization, and they can use this link to request the access package. Users from that organization who are already invited into your directory can also use that link.\\\\n \\\\n@@ -99,7 +99,7 @@ To ensure people outside of your organization can request access packages and ge\\\\n \\\\n - Make sure to exclude the Entitlement Management app from any Conditional Access policies that impact guest users.

    "Response": "Several documentation pages have been updated. The 'Global Secure Access Client for iOS' guide has had its 'ms.date' updated and a section on supported traffic forwarding profiles removed. The 'Current Known Limitations' for Global Secure Access has been expanded with additional limitations for iOS, and the 'ms.date' has been updated.\n\nMultiple quickstart guides for native authentication in Microsoft Entra ID (for Android, iOS, macOS, and React SPAs) have been revised to streamline prerequisite steps, particularly around creating and registering applications and user flows within external tenants, and the 'ms.date' has been updated where applicable. The 'Native Authentication API Reference' document has also seen minor updates to prerequisites and links, with a date change. Finally, the 'Entitlement Management External Users' guide has undergone significant revisions, including updating the 'ms.date', clarifying wording around external users and their lifecycle management, and adjusting navigation paths for settings.",

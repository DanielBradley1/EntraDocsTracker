The synergy between these platforms empowers customers with enhanced security and seamless connectivity.\\\\n-\\\\n-This document contains steps to deploy these solutions side by side, specifically, Microsoft Entra Private Access (with Private DNS feature enabled) and Cisco Umbrella for internet access and DNS-layer security.\\\\n- \\\\n-## Configuration overview\\\\n-\\\\n-In Microsoft Entra, you enable the Private Access traffic forwarding profile and disable the Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles. You also enable and configure the Private DNS feature of Private Access. In Cisco, you capture Internet Access traffic.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The clients must be installed on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Microsoft Entra joined device or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Microsoft Entra Private Access configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Enable the Microsoft Entra Private Access traffic forwarding profile for your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information about enabling and disabling profiles, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Global Secure Access Client on end-user devices. For more information about clients, see [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md). To learn how to install the Windows client, see [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector. To learn how to install and configure the connector, see [How to configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Connector version v1.5.3829.0 or higher is required for Private DNS.\\\\n-\\\\n-Configure Quick Access to your private resources and set up Private DNS and DNS suffixes. To learn how to configure Quick Access, see [How to configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Cisco configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Add domain suffixes from Microsoft Entra Quick Access and Microsoft Entra service FQDN in Domain Management in Internal domains list to bypass Cisco’s Umbrella DNS. Add Microsoft Entra service FQDN and IPs in Domain Management in External domains list to bypass Cisco’s Secure Web Gateway (SWG).\\\\n-1. From Cisco Umbrella portal, go to **Deployments > Configuration > Domain Management**.\\\\n-1. In **Internal Domains** section, add these and save. \\\\n-    - `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com`.\\\\n-    - `<quickaccessapplicationid>.globalsecureaccess.local` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > `quickaccessapplicationid` is the application id of the quick access app you’ve configured.\\\\n-    - DNS suffixes you’ve configured in the Quick Access application.\\\\n-1. In the **External Domains & IPs** section, add these FQDN and IPs and save.\\\\n-    -  `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com, 150.171.19.0/24, 150.171.20.0/24, 13.107.232.0/24, 13.107.233.0/24, 150.171.15.0/24, 150.171.18.0/24, 151.206.0.0/16, 6.6.0.0/16`\\\\n-        > [!NOTE] \\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` for the FQDN.\\\\n-1. Restart Cisco Umbrella and Cisco SWG client services or restart the machine where the clients are installed.\\\\n-\\\\n-After both clients are installed and running side by side and configurations from admin portals are complete, go to the system tray to check that Global Secure Access and Cisco clients are enabled.\\\\n-\\\\n-Verify configuration for Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. Right click on the **Global Secure Access client > Advanced Diagnostics > Forwarding Profile** and verify that only Private Access rules are applied to this client.\\\\n-1. In **Advanced Diagnostics > Health Check** ensure no checks are failing.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Test traffic flow\\\\n-Microsoft’s SSE configuration: Enable Microsoft Entra Private Access, disable Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles.\\\\n-\\\\n-Cisco SSE configuration: Internet Access traffic is captured. The Private Access traffic is excluded.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client icon and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. Select the **Traffic** tab and select **Start collecting**.\\\\n-1. Access private resources you’ve configured with Entra Private Access such as SMB File share. Open `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\YourFileServer.yourdomain.com` by using the **Start/Run** menu from an explorer window.\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, select **Stop collecting**.\\\\n-1. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, scroll to observe the traffic generated to confirm that Private Access traffic was handled by the Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. You can also verify that the traffic is captured by Microsoft Entra by validating the traffic in the Global Secure Access traffic logs from Microsoft Entra admin center in **Global Secure Access > Monitor > Traffic logs**.\\\\n-1. Access any websites from the browsers and validate that internet traffic is missing from Global Secure Access traffic logs and only captured in Cisco Umbrella.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- [What is Global Secure Access?](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"56e606b753655d724005ad5566540e821d753ff9\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/concept-traffic-dashboard.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 12,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 5,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/de99cbaa320ee4985627c53d775eaf29df73a2e5/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fconcept-traffic-dashboard.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/de99cbaa320ee4985627c53d775eaf29df73a2e5/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fconcept-traffic-dashboard.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fconcept-traffic-dashboard.md?ref=de99cbaa320ee4985627c53d775eaf29df73a2e5\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -5,7 +5,7 @@ author: kenwith\\\\n ms.author: kenwith\\\\n manager: dougeby\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 07/29/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 10/07/2025\\\\n ms.service: global-secure-access\\\\n ai-usage: ai-assisted\\\\n ---\\\\n@@ -66,7 +66,7 @@ This widget provides the following alerts:\\\\n - **Unhealthy remote network**: An unhealthy remote network has one or more device links disconnected.\\\\n - **Increased external tenants activity**: The number of users accessing external tenants has increased.\\\\n - **Token and device inconsistency**: The original token is used on a different device.\\\\n-- **Web content blocked**: Access to the website has been blocked.\\\\n+- **Web content blocked**: Access to the website is blocked.\\\\n \\\\n ![Screenshot of the alerts and notifications widget showing two alert types.](media/concept-traffic-dashboard/dashboard-alerts-notifications.png)\\\\n \\\\n@@ -136,7 +136,7 @@ Select **View all web categories** to view more details about your network traff\\\\n \\\\n ## Device status\\\\n \\\\n-The **Device status** widgets display the active and inactive devices that you have deployed.\\\\n+The **Device status** widgets display the active and inactive devices that you deployed.\\\\n \\\\n - **Active devices**: The number of distinct device IDs seen in the last 24 hours and the % change during that time.\\\\n - **Inactive devices**: The number of distinct device IDs that were seen in the last seven days, but not during the last 24 hours.

Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access offer complementary Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) capabilities. When integrated, these platforms enhance security and connectivity for diverse access scenarios.\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide outlines how to configure and deploy Global Secure Access solutions alongside Cisco Secure Access SSE offerings. By using both platforms, you can optimize your organization's security posture while maintaining high-performance connectivity for private applications, Microsoft 365 traffic, and internet access.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Scenarios\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide covers the following coexistence scenarios:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access](#1-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access).**\\\\n+In this scenario, Global Secure Access handles private application traffic. Cisco Secure Internet Access provides DNS security and SWG capabilities.\\\\n+\\\\n+2.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#2-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+In this scenario, both clients handle traffic for separate private applications. Global Secure Access handles private applications in Microsoft Entra Private Access, while the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.\\\\n+\\\\n+3.  **[Microsoft Entra Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#3-microsoft-entra-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+Global Secure Access manages all Microsoft 365 traffic. The Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.\\\\n+\\\\n+4.  **[Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Private Access](#4-microsoft-entra-internet-access-and-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+Global Secure Access manages internet and Microsoft traffic. Cisco Secure Access handles only Private Access with the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module.\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+To configure Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access for a unified SASE solution:\\\\n+\\\\n+- Set up Global Secure Access (Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access).\\\\n+- Configure Cisco Secure Internet Access and Secure Private Access.\\\\n+- Establish required FQDN and IP bypasses for integration between the platforms.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Global Secure Access setup\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Enable and disable different traffic forwarding profiles** for your Microsoft Entra tenant. See [Traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).\\\\n+1. **Install and configure the private network connector** for Private Access applications. See [Configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n+1. **Configure Quick Access** to private resources and set up private DNS and DNS suffixes. See [Configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).\\\\n+1. **Install and configure the Global Secure Access client** on end-user devices. See [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Private Network Connectors are required for Private Access applications.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Cisco Secure Access setup\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Set up a resource connector** for private applications. See Cisco documentation for [managing resource connectors and connector groups](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manage-resource-connectors-and-connector-groups).\\\\n+1. **Provision users and groups**. Integration with Microsoft Entra ID provides the best user experience. See Cisco documentation for [Microsoft Entra ID SAML configuration](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/configure-azure-for-saml).\\\\n+1. **Add private resources and create access policies**.

Sign-in was from a suspicious IP Address:\\\\n+- If the sign-in was from a suspicious IP Address:\\\\n    1. Confirm if the IP address shows suspicious behavior in your environment.\\\\n    1. Does the IP generate a high number of failures for a user or set of users in your directory?\\\\n    1. Is the traffic of the IP coming from an unexpected protocol or application, for example Exchange legacy protocols?\\\\n    1. If the IP address corresponds to a cloud service provider, rule out that there are no legitimate enterprise applications running from the same IP.\\\\n-1.

The synergy between these platforms empowers customers with enhanced security and seamless connectivity.\\\\n-\\\\n-This document contains steps to deploy these solutions side by side, specifically, Microsoft Entra Private Access (with Private DNS feature enabled) and Cisco Umbrella for internet access and DNS-layer security.\\\\n- \\\\n-## Configuration overview\\\\n-\\\\n-In Microsoft Entra, you enable the Private Access traffic forwarding profile and disable the Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles. You also enable and configure the Private DNS feature of Private Access. In Cisco, you capture Internet Access traffic.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The clients must be installed on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Microsoft Entra joined device or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Microsoft Entra Private Access configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Enable the Microsoft Entra Private Access traffic forwarding profile for your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information about enabling and disabling profiles, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Global Secure Access Client on end-user devices. For more information about clients, see [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md). To learn how to install the Windows client, see [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector. To learn how to install and configure the connector, see [How to configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Connector version v1.5.3829.0 or higher is required for Private DNS.\\\\n-\\\\n-Configure Quick Access to your private resources and set up Private DNS and DNS suffixes. To learn how to configure Quick Access, see [How to configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Cisco configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Add domain suffixes from Microsoft Entra Quick Access and Microsoft Entra service FQDN in Domain Management in Internal domains list to bypass Cisco’s Umbrella DNS. Add Microsoft Entra service FQDN and IPs in Domain Management in External domains list to bypass Cisco’s Secure Web Gateway (SWG).\\\\n-1. From Cisco Umbrella portal, go to **Deployments > Configuration > Domain Management**.\\\\n-1. In **Internal Domains** section, add these and save. \\\\n-    - `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com`.\\\\n-    - `<quickaccessapplicationid>.globalsecureaccess.local` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > `quickaccessapplicationid` is the application id of the quick access app you’ve configured.\\\\n-    - DNS suffixes you’ve configured in the Quick Access application.\\\\n-1. In the **External Domains & IPs** section, add these FQDN and IPs and save.\\\\n-    -  `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com, 150.171.19.0/24, 150.171.20.0/24, 13.107.232.0/24, 13.107.233.0/24, 150.171.15.0/24, 150.171.18.0/24, 151.206.0.0/16, 6.6.0.0/16`\\\\n-        > [!NOTE] \\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` for the FQDN.\\\\n-1. Restart Cisco Umbrella and Cisco SWG client services or restart the machine where the clients are installed.\\\\n-\\\\n-After both clients are installed and running side by side and configurations from admin portals are complete, go to the system tray to check that Global Secure Access and Cisco clients are enabled.\\\\n-\\\\n-Verify configuration for Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. Right click on the **Global Secure Access client > Advanced Diagnostics > Forwarding Profile** and verify that only Private Access rules are applied to this client.\\\\n-1. In **Advanced Diagnostics > Health Check** ensure no checks are failing.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Test traffic flow\\\\n-Microsoft’s SSE configuration: Enable Microsoft Entra Private Access, disable Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles.\\\\n-\\\\n-Cisco SSE configuration: Internet Access traffic is captured. The Private Access traffic is excluded.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client icon and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. Select the **Traffic** tab and select **Start collecting**.\\\\n-1. Access private resources you’ve configured with Entra Private Access such as SMB File share. Open `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\YourFileServer.yourdomain.com` by using the **Start/Run** menu from an explorer window.\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, select **Stop collecting**.\\\\n-1. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, scroll to observe the traffic generated to confirm that Private Access traffic was handled by the Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1.

Enable Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access forwarding profiles.\\\\n+1. Install and configure the Global Secure Access client for Windows or macOS.\\\\n+1. Add an Internet Access traffic forwarding profile [custom bypass](#adding-a-custom-bypass-for-cisco-asa) to exclude Cisco ASA remote access URL and public IP address.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Cisco configuration:**\\\\n+1. Configure Cisco ASA remote access VPN connection profile for [split-include](#split-include-configuration-asa) configuration, as described previously.\\\\n+1. Install Cisco Secure Client or AnyConnect software.\\\\n+1. Connect to your VPN endpoint.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Validation:**\\\\n+1. Ensure both clients are enabled.\\\\n+1. To verify rules are applied and health checks pass, use Advanced Diagnostics in the Global Secure Access client.\\\\n+1. Test traffic flow by accessing various sites and validating traffic logs in both platforms.\\\\n+    1. Start collecting traffic in Global Secure Access client.\\\\n+    2. Access websites: `bing.com`, `salesforce.com`, `outlook.office365.com`.\\\\n+    3. Verify Global Secure Access client captures traffic from these sites.\\\\n+    4. Validate traffic in Microsoft Entra admin center traffic logs.\\\\n+    5. Validate website traffic **isn't** captured by your Cisco ASA.\\\\n+    6. Access private resources via Cisco Secure Client (for example, RDP session).\\\\n+    7. Validate RDP traffic is missing from Global Secure Access logs and present in Cisco logs.\\\\n+    8. Stop collecting traffic in Global Secure Access client.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### 2. Microsoft Entra Private Access, Internet Access, and Microsoft Access with Cisco ASA Remote Access VPN for private access\\\\n+\\\\n+**Global Secure Access configuration:**\\\\n+1. Enable Microsoft Entra Internet Access, Private Access, and Microsoft Access forwarding profiles.\\\\n+1. Install a Private Network Connector for Microsoft Entra Private Access.\\\\n+1. Configure Quick Access and set up Private DNS.\\\\n+1. Create an app segment, for example an SMB file share. This will be the application you want to access through Global Secure Access and not Cisco ASA VPN.\\\\n+1. Add an Internet Access traffic forwarding profile [custom bypass](#adding-a-custom-bypass-for-cisco-asa) to exclude Cisco ASA remote access URL and public IP address.\\\\n+1. Install and configure the Global Secure Access client for Windows or macOS.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Cisco configuration:**\\\\n+1. Configure Cisco ASA remote access VPN connection profile for [split-include](#split-include-configuration-asa) configuration, as described previously.\\\\n+1. Ensure that in step 1 you have configured applications to access through Cisco ASA VPN, for example an RDP server. This should be different apps than configured in Global Secure Access.\\\\n+1. Install Cisco Secure Client software.\\\\n+1. Connect to your VPN endpoint.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Validation:**\\\\n+1. Ensure both clients are enabled.\\\\n+1. To verify rules are applied and health checks pass, use Advanced Diagnostics in the Global Secure Access client.\\\\n+1.

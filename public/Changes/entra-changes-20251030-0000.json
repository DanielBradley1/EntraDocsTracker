This situation creates an extended opportunity for threat actors to establish persistence by registering additional strong authentication methods under the compromised account during the credential lifetime. A reusable TAP that falls into the wrong hands lets threat actors conduct reconnaissance activities across multiple sessions, gradually mapping the environment and identifying high-value targets while maintaining legitimate-looking access patterns. The compromised TAP can also serve as a reliable backdoor mechanism, allowing threat actors to maintain access even if other compromised credentials are detected and revoked, since the TAP appears as a legitimate administrative tool in security logs.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Remediation action**\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Configure Temporary Access Pass for one-time use in authentication methods policy](/entra/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass#enable-the-temporary-access-pass-policy) \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"2375f6d8983f4abf2988233777cffcda0751ac79\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/includes/secure-recommendations/21847.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21847.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21847.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21847.md?ref=5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.topic: include\\\\n ms.date: 08/19/2025\\\\n ms.custom: Identity-Secure-Recommendation\\\\n+# minimumlicense: P1\\\\n # sfipillar: Protect identities and secrets\\\\n # category: Credential management\\\\n # risklevel: High\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"518206ca8af9c210f5cad1ca05b50d3189741e33\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/includes/secure-recommendations/21848.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21848.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21848.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21848.md?ref=5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.topic: include\\\\n ms.date: 10/09/2025\\\\n ms.custom: Identity-Secure-Recommendation\\\\n+# minimumlicense: P1\\\\n # sfipillar: Protect identities and secrets\\\\n # category: Credential management\\\\n # risklevel: Medium\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"be31378bbb0f8f35f0275df33c575a2cc42956e6\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/includes/secure-recommendations/21849.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 20,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 20,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21849.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21849.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21849.md?ref=5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,20 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Smart lockout duration is set to a minimum of 60 \\\\n+ms.author: joflore\\\\n+author: MicrosoftGuyJFlo\\\\n+ms.service: entra-id\\\\n+ms.topic: include\\\\n+ms.date: 10/27/2025\\\\n+ms.custom: Identity-Secure-Recommendation\\\\n+# minimumlicense: P1\\\\n+# sfipillar: Protect identities and secrets\\\\n+# category: Credential management\\\\n+# risklevel: Medium\\\\n+# userimpact: Low\\\\n+# implementationcost: Low\\\\n+---\\\\n+When Smart Lockout duration is configured below the default 60 seconds, threat actors can exploit shortened lockout periods to conduct password spray and credential stuffing attacks more effectively.

    "Response": "This commit addresses security configurations and recommendations within Microsoft Entra ID. It updates documentation to reflect license changes for various security checks, making many features available without specific premium licenses. Additionally, several new security recommendations and best practices have been introduced, focusing on areas like workload identity security, temporary access pass usage, and the blocking of legacy PowerShell modules. The changes also refine existing security recommendations related to service principals and entitlement management.",

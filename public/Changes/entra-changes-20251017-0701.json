Or perhaps you configured SAP ECC or other applications to rely on Windows Server via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Kerberos. In these situations, you provision users into Windows Server AD. These users are then synchronized into Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n 1. **Design the Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology.** If you are using SuccessFactors and have Windows Server AD, then you will need to install the provisioning agent to provision users into those domains. The Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology depends on the number of cloud HR app tenants and Active Directory child domains that you plan to integrate. If you have multiple Active Directory domains, it depends on whether the Active Directory domains are contiguous or [disjoint](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/disjoint-namespace).

The integration supports a broad range of employee-related data, including:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Core identity attributes**, name, employee ID, employment status.\\\\n-- **Organizational data**, including cost center, business unit, and reporting structure.\\\\n-- **Personal data**, such as date of birth, nationality, and contact information.\\\\n-- **Communication and external identifiers**, such as email addresses and external system IDs.\\\\n-\\\\n-This scenario is achieved by reading from multiple SAP HCM infotypes (Example: 0000, 0001, 0002, 0006, 0105), which are logical groupings of related employee data. These are accessed through SAP function modules (FMs) or BAPIs that abstract the underlying table structures.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Key Aspects of SAP IDM Integration\\\\n-\\\\n-A notable architectural feature of SAP IDM is its use of a staging area—a conceptually distinct layer between the source system (SAP HCM) and the productive identity store. This staging area offers several advantages:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Data validation and transformation**: Data is reviewed, enriched, or transformed before being committed to the identity store.\\\\n-- **Workflow integration**: Approval workflows are triggered based on staged data, allowing for human-in-the-loop validation.\\\\n-- **Schema flexibility**: Changes in the SAP HCM schema are accommodated by adjusting mappings in the staging area without altering the identity store schema.\\\\n-\\\\n-The staging area is equivalent to a \\\\\\\"connector space\\\\\\\" — a buffer zone where data is inspected and controlled before it becomes authoritative. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Contrast with Microsoft Entra Provisioning Flow\\\\n-\\\\n-Currently, Microsoft Entra’s inbound provisioning flow doesn't include a native equivalent of this staging area. Data transformations and validations must be handled externally; typically in middleware (Example: Azure Logic Apps or PowerShell scripts) before invoking the Entra provisioning API.

In these situations, you provision users into Windows Server AD. These users are then synchronized into Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n 1. **Design the Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology.** If you are using SuccessFactors and have Windows Server AD, then you will need to install the provisioning agent to provision users into those domains. The Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology depends on the number of cloud HR app tenants and Active Directory child domains that you plan to integrate. If you have multiple Active Directory domains, it depends on whether the Active Directory domains are contiguous or [disjoint](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/disjoint-namespace).

The integration supports a broad range of employee-related data, including:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Core identity attributes**, name, employee ID, employment status.\\\\n-- **Organizational data**, including cost center, business unit, and reporting structure.\\\\n-- **Personal data**, such as date of birth, nationality, and contact information.\\\\n-- **Communication and external identifiers**, such as email addresses and external system IDs.\\\\n-\\\\n-This scenario is achieved by reading from multiple SAP HCM infotypes (Example: 0000, 0001, 0002, 0006, 0105), which are logical groupings of related employee data. These are accessed through SAP function modules (FMs) or BAPIs that abstract the underlying table structures.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Key Aspects of SAP IDM Integration\\\\n-\\\\n-A notable architectural feature of SAP IDM is its use of a staging area—a conceptually distinct layer between the source system (SAP HCM) and the productive identity store. This staging area offers several advantages:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Data validation and transformation**: Data is reviewed, enriched, or transformed before being committed to the identity store.\\\\n-- **Workflow integration**: Approval workflows are triggered based on staged data, allowing for human-in-the-loop validation.\\\\n-- **Schema flexibility**: Changes in the SAP HCM schema are accommodated by adjusting mappings in the staging area without altering the identity store schema.\\\\n-\\\\n-The staging area is equivalent to a \\\\\\\"connector space\\\\\\\" — a buffer zone where data is inspected and controlled before it becomes authoritative. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Contrast with Microsoft Entra Provisioning Flow\\\\n-\\\\n-Currently, Microsoft Entra’s inbound provisioning flow doesn't include a native equivalent of this staging area. Data transformations and validations must be handled externally; typically in middleware (Example: Azure Logic Apps or PowerShell scripts) before invoking the Entra provisioning API.

    "Response": "This commit updates the documentation for the Global Secure Access client on Android. The primary changes involve adjusting the `ms.date` property and refining the wording for clarity and grammatical correctness. Several minor edits have also been made to improve the flow and precision of the text, particularly concerning the integration of the client within the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app and its deployment scenarios. The images referenced in the documentation have also had their descriptive text updated for greater accuracy.",

Starting August 2025, the Secure Storage rollout will make Secure Enclave the default key storage for all new device registrations. New device registrations will use secure storage model by default. Existing devices that do not support Secure Enclave will have registration keys stored in the user's iCloud Keychain instead of the Login Keychain, which provides stronger protection than legacy Login Keychain storage.

    "Response": "This commit updates the documentation for the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices. It removes a note about the public preview of Platform SSO for macOS, directing users to a different article for more information. Additionally, it clarifies the transition from Apple's Keychain to Secure Enclave for device identity key storage, explaining that new device registrations will default to Secure Enclave from August 2025, with existing devices using iCloud Keychain for enhanced security.",

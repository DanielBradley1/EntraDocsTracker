    "Response": "This commit updates a Microsoft Entra ID documentation page on authentication methods. The primary changes involve:\n\n*   **Date Update:** The `ms.date` metadata has been moved forward to October 22, 2025, from March 4, 2025.\n*   **Clarification on User Registration Data:** Additional text has been added to explain that while user registration data typically updates within 36 hours, a small number of users might experience delays, and in such cases, users should check back after another 24 hours.\n*   **Latency Note Refinement:** The note regarding data latency has been slightly rephrased for clarity, incorporating the same 36-hour and 24-hour recheck information as mentioned above.",

Instead, it relies on the state of the certificate revocation list (CRL) check that's performed when the session was last backed up. If you need to revoke before this backup expires, you should explicitly revoke the session instead of waiting for the CRL.  \\\"\\r\\n}.

    "Response": "The changes update the documentation for the backup authentication system. A new section has been added detailing the evaluation of report-only Conditional Access policies when processed by the backup authentication system. It clarifies that these policies will appear in the 'Conditional Access' tab of sign-in logs, not the 'Report-only' tab, and explains how to filter sign-in logs to identify events processed by the backup authentication system.",

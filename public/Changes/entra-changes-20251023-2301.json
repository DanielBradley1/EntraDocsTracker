      "Response": "This commit updates the Microsoft Entra Verified ID partner page. The `ms.date` metadata has been advanced to 14th October 2025. The main change is a significant restructuring and expansion of the IDV partner list, moving from a simple table of partners and descriptions to a more detailed table that includes partner names, links to their specific documentation, and a concise description of their service integration with Microsoft Entra Verified ID. Several new partners have also been added.",

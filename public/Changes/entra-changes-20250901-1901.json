Existing installations will be auto-upgraded to this build starting September 4, 2025 and will be done in multiple phases.  \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Added Features \\\\n+\\\\n+- Improved the setup process for Application-Based Authentication to handle TPM-backed certificates (certificates protected by a Trusted Platform Module, see [What is a TPM?](/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview)). The system now tests a certificate’s signing capability upfront and automatically falls back to software-based certificates if TPM signature fails. \\\\n+- Implemented automatic removal of certificates if an Application-Based Authentication configuration fails after a certificate is created. This prevents unused certificates from lingering on the server in failure scenarios, improving security by avoiding accumulation of orphaned certificates. \\\\n+\\\\n+### Bug fixes\\\\n+\\\\n+- Resolved an issue on FIPS-enabled servers that was causing setup failures. Application-Based Authentication now works correctly on servers with FIPS mode enabled by using FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms. \\\\n+  > [!TIP]\\\\n+  > FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) mode is a Windows security setting that enforces the use of cryptographic algorithms for sensitive data. When FIPS mode is enabled, only FIPS-compliant algorithms can be used, which is why this fix ensures compatibility for environments requiring strict security standards.\\\\n+- Fixed an issue where certificate auto-rotation was incorrectly reported as active when the scheduler was suspended. The auto-rotation logic now checks the scheduler’s state before indicating status, ensuring the *View or export current configuration wizard* accurately reflects whether auto-rotation is enabled. \\\\n+- Removed an inappropriate admin audit event that was being logged for automatic certificate operations. These background certificate actions no longer generate administrative audit log entries, resulting in a cleaner audit trail (only actual administrator-initiated changes will appear in the Entra Connect Sync audit logs). \\\\n+\\\\n ## 2.5.76.0\\\\n \\\\n ### Release status\\\\n \\\\n-07/31/2025: Released for download via the Microsoft Entra admin center.

    "Response": "Here's a summary of the changes in the provided commit files:\n\nThis commit updates documentation for Microsoft Entra ID. Firstly, it clarifies the `AssertionConsumerService` value for external tenants in the direct federation documentation, suggesting the addition of a specific callback/ACS URL if required by the external Identity Provider. Secondly, it corrects a minor typo in a React tutorial regarding the `challenge_type` property. Finally, it updates the Microsoft Entra Connect version history, adding details for version 2.5.79.0, including new features related to Application-Based Authentication and bug fixes for FIPS compliance and certificate auto-rotation reporting.",

If you haven't already done so, read [Recoverability best practices](recoverability-overview.md) for foundational knowledge.\\\\n+Managing deletions in Microsoft Entra ID is a critical aspect of maintaining the integrity and availability of your organization's identity infrastructure. This article provides a comprehensive guide to understand the differences between soft and hard deletions, monitor for deletions, and recover or recreate objects in your Microsoft Entra tenant. Whether you're dealing with accidental deletions or preparing recovery strategies, this guide equips you with the knowledge and tools to minimize disruption and ensure continuity. For foundational insights, start with [Recoverability best practices](recoverability-overview.md).\\\\n \\\\n ## Monitor for deletions\\\\n \\\\n-The [Microsoft Entra audit log](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs.md) contains information on all delete operations performed in your tenant.

One important one is IssuerUri. This property is a URI that is used by Microsoft Entra ID to identify the domain that the token is associated with. The URI doesn’t need to resolve to anything but it must be a valid URI. By default, Microsoft Entra ID sets the URI to the value of the federation service identifier in your on-premises AD FS configuration.\\\\n+When a domain is federated with Microsoft Entra ID, several properties are set on the domain in Azure.

For example, let's say you have set up federation between Microsoft Entra ID and your on-premises environment. For this document, the domain, bmcontoso.com is being used.

The reason is, Microsoft Entra ID has a constraint that doesn't allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain. \\\\n+When you attempt to federate the bmfabrikam.com domain, an error occurs. This occurs because Microsoft Entra ID doesn’t allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain. \\\\n \\\\n ### SupportMultipleDomain Parameter\\\\n-To work around this constraint, you need to add a different IssuerUri, which can be done by using the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter. This parameter is used with the following cmdlets:\\\\n \\\\n-* `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`\\\\n-* `Update-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> SupportMultipleDomain parameter is no longer available and does not work with the following modules:\\\\n+> * `Microsoft.Graph`\\\\n+> * `Microsoft.Entra`\\\\n \\\\n-This parameter makes Microsoft Entra ID configure the IssuerUri so that it's based on the name of the domain. The IssuerUri will be unique across directories in Microsoft Entra ID. Using the parameter allows the PowerShell command to complete successfully.\\\\n+> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> To federate multiple domains, you might need to make changes one by one because the -SupportMultipleDomain parameter is no longer available.\\\\n \\\\n-`-SupportMultipleDomain` doesn't change the other endpoints, which are still configured to point to the federation service on adfs.bmcontoso.com.\\\\n+<a name='how-to-update-the-trust-between-ad-fs-and-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n \\\\n-`-SupportMultipleDomain` also ensures that the AD FS system includes the proper Issuer value in tokens issued for Microsoft Entra ID. This value is set by taking the domain portion of the user's UPN and using it as the domain in the IssuerUri, that is, `https://{upn suffix}/adfs/services/trust`.\\\\n+## How to update the trust between AD FS and Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n \\\\n-Thus during authentication to Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365, the IssuerUri element in the user’s token is used to locate the domain in Microsoft Entra ID. If a match can't be found, the authentication fails.\\\\n+If you've added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and changed the token signing certificate, you're one step away from updating your federation information in Entra ID. \\\\n \\\\n-For example, if a user’s UPN is bsimon@bmcontoso.com, the IssuerUri element in the token, AD FS issuer, is set to `http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`. This element matches the Microsoft Entra configuration, and authentication succeeds.\\\\n+Follow these steps to update your federation information in Entra ID:\\\\n \\\\n-The following customized claim rule implements this logic:\\\\n+1. Open a new PowerShell session and run the below commands to install the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module:\\\\n \\\\n-```\\\\n-c:[Type == \\\\\\\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN\\\\\\\"] => issue(Type = \\\\\\\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid\\\\\\\", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, \\\\\\\".+@(?<domain>.+)\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/\\\\\\\"));\\\\n-```\\\\n+   > [!NOTE] \\\\n+   > `-allowclobber` will override warning messages about installation conflicts and overwrite existing commands that have the same name as commands being installed by a module.

The reason is, when it's originally set up without the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, the IssuerUri is set with the default value. In the screenshot below, you can see the IssuerUri is set to `https://adfs.bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`.\\\\n+Follow these steps to add the new top-level domain using PowerShell:\\\\n \\\\n-If you have successfully added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and then attempt to convert it using `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainName <your domain>`, you'll get an error.\\\\n+1. On a machine that has [Azure AD PowerShell module](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)) installed on it run the following PowerShell: `$cred=Get-Credential`.\\\\n+1.

In PowerShell, enter `Connect-Entra -Scopes 'Domain.ReadWrite.All'`\\\\n+1.

If you have already added a domain, and didn't use the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, start with the steps for removing and updating your original domain. If you haven't added a top-level domain yet, you can start with the steps for adding a domain using PowerShell of Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n+  ```powershell\\\\n+    New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainId \\\\\\\"contoso.com\\\\\\\" -ActiveSigninUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/2005/usernamemixed\\\\\\\" -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Contoso\\\\\\\" -IssuerUri \\\\\\\" http://contoso.com/adfs/services/trust\\\\\\\" -MetadataExchangeUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/mex\\\\\\\" -PassiveSigninUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/\\\\\\\" -SignOutUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/\\\\\\\" -SigningCertificate <*Base64 Encoded Format cert*> -FederatedIdpMfaBehavior \\\\\\\"acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp\\\\\\\" -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol \\\\\\\"wsFed\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  ```\\\\n \\\\n-Use the following steps to remove the Microsoft Online trust and update your original domain.\\\\n+Follow these steps to add the new top-level domain using Microsoft Entra Connect:\\\\n \\\\n-1.

The date for mandatory MFA enforcement has been updated, and the old screenshots related to postponing MFA have been removed, with a note that customers need to contact support for postponement. Lastly, minor formatting corrections have been made to navigation paths in the custom security attributes documentation, and a WAM redirect URI format has been corrected.",

What is Microsoft Entra authentication?\\\\n \\\\n-One of the main features of an identity platform is to verify, or *authenticate*, credentials when a user signs in to a device, application, or service. In Microsoft Entra ID, authentication involves more than just the verification of a username and password. To improve security and reduce the need for help desk assistance, Microsoft Entra authentication includes the following components:\\\\n+One of the main features of an identity platform is to verify, or *authenticate*, credentials when a user signs in to a device, application, or service. In Microsoft Entra ID, authentication involves more than just the verification of a username and password. To improve security and reduce the need for help-desk assistance, Microsoft Entra authentication includes the following components:\\\\n \\\\n-* Self-service password reset\\\\n-* Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication\\\\n-* Hybrid integration to write password changes back to on-premises environment\\\\n+* Self-service password reset (SSPR)\\\\n+* Multifactor authentication (MFA)\\\\n+* Hybrid integration to write password changes back to an on-premises environment\\\\n * Hybrid integration to enforce password protection policies for an on-premises environment\\\\n * Passwordless authentication\\\\n \\\\n-Take a look at our short video to learn more about these authentication components.\\\\n+To learn more about these authentication components, watch our short video.\\\\n \\\\n > [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=5ee3cad5-3360-48da-b520-1a0d96710a38]\\\\n \\\\n-## Improve the end-user experience\\\\n+## Improvements to the user experience\\\\n \\\\n-Microsoft Entra ID helps to protect a user's identity and simplify their sign-in experience. Features like self-service password reset let users update or change their passwords using a web browser from any device. This feature is especially useful when the user has forgotten their password or their account is locked. Without waiting for a helpdesk or administrator to provide support, a user can unblock themselves and continue to work.\\\\n+Microsoft Entra ID helps protect users' identities and simplify their sign-in experience. Features like SSPR let users update or change their passwords by using a web browser from any device. This feature is especially useful when users forget their passwords or their accounts are locked. Without waiting for a helpdesk or administrator to provide support, users can unblock themselves and continue to work.\\\\n \\\\n-Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication lets users choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or mobile app notification. This ability reduces the requirement for a single, fixed form of secondary authentication like a hardware token. If the user doesn't currently have one form of additional authentication, they can choose a different method and continue to work.\\\\n+MFA lets users choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or a mobile app notification.

Capabilities like Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys let users sign in to devices or applications without a password. This ability can reduce the complexity of managing passwords across environments.\\\\n \\\\n ## Self-service password reset\\\\n \\\\n-Self-service password reset gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. If a user's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application.\\\\n+SSPR gives users the ability to change or reset their passwords with no administrator or help-desk involvement. If users' accounts are locked or they forget their passwords, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help-desk calls and loss of productivity when users can't sign in to their devices or applications.\\\\n \\\\n-Self-service password reset works in the following scenarios:\\\\n+SSPR works in the following scenarios:\\\\n \\\\n-* **Password change -** when a user knows their password but wants to change it to something new.\\\\n-* **Password reset -** when a user can't sign in, such as when they forgot password, and want to reset their password.\\\\n-* **Account unlock -** when a user can't sign in because their account is locked out and want to unlock their account.\\\\n+* **Password change**: When a user knows the password but wants to change it to something new.\\\\n+* **Password reset**: When a user can't sign in (for example, after forgetting the password) and wants to reset the password.\\\\n+* **Account unlock**: When a user can't sign in because the account is locked, and the user wants to unlock the account.\\\\n \\\\n-When a user updates or resets their password using self-service password reset, that password can also be written back to an on-premises Active Directory environment. Password writeback makes sure that a user can immediately use their updated credentials with on-premises devices and applications.\\\\n+When a user updates or resets a password by using SSPR, that password can also be written back to an on-premises Active Directory environment. Password writeback makes sure that a user can immediately use the updated credentials with on-premises devices and applications.\\\\n \\\\n <a name='azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication'></a>\\\\n \\\\n-## Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication\\\\n+## Multifactor authentication\\\\n \\\\n-Multifactor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification, such as to enter a code on their cellphone or to provide a fingerprint scan.\\\\n+Multifactor authentication is a process in which a user is prompted for an additional form of identification during sign-in. For example, the user is prompted to enter a code on a phone or to provide a fingerprint scan.\\\\n \\\\n-If you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, is it really the user signing in with the username and password, or is it an attacker? When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased as this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\\\\n+If you use only a password to authenticate a user, it leaves a nonsecure vector for attack. If the password is weak or is exposed elsewhere, is it really the user who's signing in with the username and password, or is it an attacker? Requiring a second form of authentication increases security because this additional factor isn't easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\\\\n \\\\n-![Conceptual image of the different forms of multifactor authentication](./media/concept-mfa-howitworks/methods.png)\\\\n+![Conceptual diagram of the various forms of multifactor authentication.](./media/concept-mfa-howitworks/methods.png)\\\\n \\\\n-Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication works by requiring two or more of the following authentication methods:\\\\n+Microsoft Entra MFA works by requiring two or more of the following authentication methods:\\\\n \\\\n-* Something you know, typically a password.\\\\n-* Something you have, such as a trusted device that isn't easily duplicated, like a phone or hardware key.\\\\n-* Something you are - biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan.\\\\n+* Something the user knows, typically a password\\\\n+* Something the user has, such as a trusted device or a hardware key that isn't easily duplicated\\\\n+* Something the user is; that is, biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan\\\\n \\\\n-Users can register themselves for both self-service password reset and Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication in one step to simplify the on-boarding experience. Administrators can define what forms of secondary authentication can be used. Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication can also be required when users perform a self-service password reset to further secure that process.\\\\n+Users can register themselves for both SSPR and MFA in one step to simplify the onboarding experience.

A global banned password list is automatically updated and enforced that includes known weak passwords. If a Microsoft Entra user tries to set their password to one of these weak passwords, they receive a notification to choose a more secure password.\\\\n+By default, Microsoft Entra ID blocks weak passwords such as *Password1*.

These policies can use filters to block any variation of a password that contains a name such as *Contoso* or a location like *London*, for example.\\\\n \\\\n-For hybrid security, you can integrate Microsoft Entra password protection with an on-premises Active Directory environment. A component installed in the on-premises environment receives the global banned password list and custom password protection policies from Microsoft Entra ID, and domain controllers use them to process password change events. This hybrid approach makes sure that no matter how or where a user changes their credentials, you enforce the use of strong passwords.\\\\n+For hybrid security, you can integrate Microsoft Entra password protection with an on-premises Active Directory environment.

An example of such a solution is a proxy that uses a certificate trust chain outside Apple system root certificates.\\\\n \\\\n ## Related content\\\\n \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"cdf1573a0191491797dd5c7a3073ac39658c52b4\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/fundamentals/copilot-entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 26,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 28,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/ecca2938dca70fa763c53bb867428f3db75c2edd/docs%2Ffundamentals%2Fcopilot-entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/ecca2938dca70fa763c53bb867428f3db75c2edd/docs%2Ffundamentals%2Fcopilot-entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Ffundamentals%2Fcopilot-entra-security-scenarios.md?ref=ecca2938dca70fa763c53bb867428f3db75c2edd\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -28,7 +28,7 @@ Security Copilot is a part of the Microsoft Entra admin center, and you can use\\\\n | Microsoft Entra ID | [Tenants](#tenants)<br>[Users](#users)<br>[Groups](#groups)<br>[Devices](#devices)<br>[Roles and administrators](#roles-and-administrators)<br>[Domain services](#domain-services)<br>[Conditional Access](#conditional-access)<br>[Authentication](#authentication)<br>[Sign in logs](#sign-in-logs)<br>[Audit logs](#audit-logs)<br>[Recommendations](#recommendations)<br>[Health monitoring alerts](#health-monitoring-alerts)<br>[Service Level Agreement](#service-level-agreement) |\\\\n | Microsoft Entra ID Protection | [Risky users](#risky-users)<br>[Application risk](#application-risk) |\\\\n | Microsoft Entra ID Governance | [Access reviews](#access-reviews)<br>[Entitlement management](#entitlement-management)<br>[Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](#privileged-identity-management-pim)<br>[Lifecycle workflows](#lifecycle-workflows) |\\\\n-| Microsoft Entra Internet Access<br>Microsoft Entra Private Access | [License Usage](#license-usage) |\\\\n+| Microsoft Entra Internet Access<br>Microsoft Entra Private Access | [License Usage](#license-usage)<br>[Global Secure Access](#global-secure-access) |\\\\n \\\\n ## Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n \\\\n@@ -438,7 +438,7 @@ Refer to the prompts and examples in [Manage employee lifecycle using Microsoft\\\\n \\\\n ## Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access\\\\n \\\\n-The following sections describe how to use Microsoft Security Copilot for scenarios and use cases within Global Secure Access.\\\\n+The following sections describe how to use Microsoft Security Copilot for scenarios and use cases within Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access.\\\\n \\\\n ### License Usage \\\\n \\\\n@@ -456,6 +456,30 @@ For more information, see:\\\\n \\\\n - [Microsoft Entra licensing](/entra/fundamentals/licensing)\\\\n \\\\n+### Global Secure Access\\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Security Copilot supports network traffic logs in Global Secure Access, making it easier to investigate and monitor network traffic usage and behavior. \\\\n+\\\\n+This enhancement provides an interactive method for analyzing network traffic logs, allowing users to obtain valuable insights without the need to write complex queries.

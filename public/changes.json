For mobile and desktop applications that don’t use modern authentication, the policy applies on each token request. The frequency of the request can vary based on the application. Similarly, for web applications, policies apply at initial sign-in and are good for the lifetime of the session at the web application. Because of differences in session lifetimes across applications, the time between policy evaluation varies.

        "Response": "This commit modifies the documentation for configuring Netskope coexistence with Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access. The changes focus on simplifying the steering configuration for private apps within the Netskope portal. Specifically, it removes detailed instructions for internet access steering and instead directs users to select 'All Private Apps' for Netskope to steer. It also removes the extensive list of domain exceptions, implying a more streamlined approach to exception handling.",

One important one is IssuerUri. This property is a URI that is used by Microsoft Entra ID to identify the domain that the token is associated with. The URI doesn’t need to resolve to anything but it must be a valid URI. By default, Microsoft Entra ID sets the URI to the value of the federation service identifier in your on-premises AD FS configuration.\\\\n+When a domain is federated with Microsoft Entra ID, several properties are set on the domain in Azure.

For example, let's say you have set up federation between Microsoft Entra ID and your on-premises environment. For this document, the domain, bmcontoso.com is being used.

The reason is, Microsoft Entra ID has a constraint that doesn't allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain. \\\\n+When you attempt to federate the bmfabrikam.com domain, an error occurs. This occurs because Microsoft Entra ID doesn’t allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain. \\\\n \\\\n ### SupportMultipleDomain Parameter\\\\n-To work around this constraint, you need to add a different IssuerUri, which can be done by using the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter. This parameter is used with the following cmdlets:\\\\n \\\\n-* `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`\\\\n-* `Update-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> SupportMultipleDomain parameter is no longer available and does not work with the following modules:\\\\n+> * `Microsoft.Graph`\\\\n+> * `Microsoft.Entra`\\\\n \\\\n-This parameter makes Microsoft Entra ID configure the IssuerUri so that it's based on the name of the domain. The IssuerUri will be unique across directories in Microsoft Entra ID. Using the parameter allows the PowerShell command to complete successfully.\\\\n+> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> To federate multiple domains, you might need to make changes one by one because the -SupportMultipleDomain parameter is no longer available.\\\\n \\\\n-`-SupportMultipleDomain` doesn't change the other endpoints, which are still configured to point to the federation service on adfs.bmcontoso.com.\\\\n+<a name='how-to-update-the-trust-between-ad-fs-and-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n \\\\n-`-SupportMultipleDomain` also ensures that the AD FS system includes the proper Issuer value in tokens issued for Microsoft Entra ID. This value is set by taking the domain portion of the user's UPN and using it as the domain in the IssuerUri, that is, `https://{upn suffix}/adfs/services/trust`.\\\\n+## How to update the trust between AD FS and Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n \\\\n-Thus during authentication to Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365, the IssuerUri element in the user’s token is used to locate the domain in Microsoft Entra ID. If a match can't be found, the authentication fails.\\\\n+If you've added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and changed the token signing certificate, you're one step away from updating your federation information in Entra ID. \\\\n \\\\n-For example, if a user’s UPN is bsimon@bmcontoso.com, the IssuerUri element in the token, AD FS issuer, is set to `http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`. This element matches the Microsoft Entra configuration, and authentication succeeds.\\\\n+Follow these steps to update your federation information in Entra ID:\\\\n \\\\n-The following customized claim rule implements this logic:\\\\n+1. Open a new PowerShell session and run the below commands to install the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module:\\\\n \\\\n-```\\\\n-c:[Type == \\\\\\\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN\\\\\\\"] => issue(Type = \\\\\\\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid\\\\\\\", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, \\\\\\\".+@(?<domain>.+)\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/\\\\\\\"));\\\\n-```\\\\n+   > [!NOTE] \\\\n+   > `-allowclobber` will override warning messages about installation conflicts and overwrite existing commands that have the same name as commands being installed by a module.

The reason is, when it's originally set up without the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, the IssuerUri is set with the default value. In the screenshot below, you can see the IssuerUri is set to `https://adfs.bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`.\\\\n+Follow these steps to add the new top-level domain using PowerShell:\\\\n \\\\n-If you have successfully added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and then attempt to convert it using `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainName <your domain>`, you'll get an error.\\\\n+1. On a machine that has [Azure AD PowerShell module](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)) installed on it run the following PowerShell: `$cred=Get-Credential`.\\\\n+1.

In PowerShell, enter `Connect-Entra -Scopes 'Domain.ReadWrite.All'`\\\\n+1.

If you have already added a domain, and didn't use the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, start with the steps for removing and updating your original domain. If you haven't added a top-level domain yet, you can start with the steps for adding a domain using PowerShell of Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n+  ```powershell\\\\n+    New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainId \\\\\\\"contoso.com\\\\\\\" -ActiveSigninUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/2005/usernamemixed\\\\\\\" -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Contoso\\\\\\\" -IssuerUri \\\\\\\" http://contoso.com/adfs/services/trust\\\\\\\" -MetadataExchangeUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/mex\\\\\\\" -PassiveSigninUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/\\\\\\\" -SignOutUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/\\\\\\\" -SigningCertificate <*Base64 Encoded Format cert*> -FederatedIdpMfaBehavior \\\\\\\"acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp\\\\\\\" -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol \\\\\\\"wsFed\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  ```\\\\n \\\\n-Use the following steps to remove the Microsoft Online trust and update your original domain.\\\\n+Follow these steps to add the new top-level domain using Microsoft Entra Connect:\\\\n \\\\n-1.

The developer guide itself has been updated to reflect that it applies to both workforce and external identities. The date for mandatory MFA enforcement has been updated, and the old screenshots related to postponing MFA have been removed, with a note that customers need to contact support for postponement. Lastly, minor formatting corrections have been made to navigation paths in the custom security attributes documentation, and a WAM redirect URI format has been corrected.",

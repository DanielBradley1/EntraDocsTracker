Universal CAE protects the GSA access tokens from theft and replay. Universal CAE revokes and revalidates network access in near real-time whenever Entra ID detects changes to the identity. Traditional Entra ID CAE requires each workload to adopt special libraries and is limited to first-party applications only.

They are vulnerable to a wide range of threats—including phishing, credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and social engineering. To realize the benefits of passwordless authentication in Microsoft Entra ID, you must ensure passwords are no longer available as a sign-in option in your tenant.\\\\n \\\\n-Password scrambling ensures that users can't authenticate using passwords. It forces them to use more secure passwordless credentials like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 security keys, or Microsoft Authenticator.

It forces them to use more secure phishing-resistant passwordless credentials, like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 security keys, or passkey in Microsoft Authenticator. Because there's no known reference of the password after scrambling, it reduces the attack surface for bad actors.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article provides guidance about how to scramble passwords for both hybrid users who are synced from on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and cloud-only users in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n \\\\n ## Prerequisites\\\\n \\\\n@@ -32,24 +33,18 @@ Password scrambling ensures that users can't authenticate using passwords. It fo\\\\n \\\\n Organizations with users synced from on-premises AD DS to Microsoft Entra ID should scramble user passwords in the on-premises environment, as on-premises is the source of authority for synced user accounts and their passwords. If your organization uses [cloud authentication](~/identity/hybrid/connect/choose-ad-authn.md) and syncs password hashes to Microsoft Entra ID, then these scrambled passwords are also synced to the cloud. The sync process ensures that users aren't aware of their passwords in either on-premises or the cloud, preventing their use and driving users towards using more secure phishing-resistant passwordless credentials.\\\\n \\\\n-### Option 1: Scramble on-premises user passwords with Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL)\\\\n-\\\\n-Scrambling user passwords with the Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL) setting is the recommended method for scrambling user passwords on-premises because it's a natively available option in AD DS. When SCRIL is enabled on a user object, the user’s AD DS password is randomized by the domain controller to a value no one knows. The user has to enroll and then must authenticate to the AD DS domain by using a smart card or Windows Hello for Business. With password hash synchronization enabled, this AD DS password hash is also synced with Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+## Scramble on-premises user passwords with a scripted random value\\\\n \\\\n-The Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon setting can be configured using the Active Directory Users and Computers tool. The following sample PowerShell script can be used to enable the setting programmatically, including for many users at once. Modify the **samAccountName** variable of the script to match your environment, and then run it in a PowerShell session. Use the credentials of an admin account with appropriate permissions in on-premises AD.\\\\n+In Active Directory, it is not possible to remove a password attribute from a user account. Therefore to prevent usage of the password you can scramble the password periodically.\\\\n \\\\n-```PowerShell\\\\n-$samAccountName = <sAMAccountName of the user>\\\\n+If you have legacy applications that still require a password for authentication, users can continue to use self-service password reset (SSPR) to set their password to a known state to access these apps for a period of time, until their password is scrambled again.\\\\n \\\\n-Import-Module ActiveDirectory\\\\n-Set-ADUser -Identity $samAccountName -SmartcardLogonRequired $true\\\\n-```\\\\n+You can use the following script to routinely scramble any passwords that users reset back to a known state.\\\\n \\\\n-### Option 2: Scramble on-premises user passwords with a scripted random value\\\\n+The script allows you to scramble a user's password in your AD DS domain. It generates a random password of 64 characters and sets it for the user specified in the variable name $samAccountName. You must modify the $samAccountName variable in the script to target the appropriate user. Use the credentials of an admin account with appropriate permissions in on-premises AD DS.\\\\n \\\\n-If you don't want to use Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL), another approach can be to scramble the password with a script. If users need to recover their passwords to access legacy apps, use a script to scramble the password. Run the script routinely to scramble any passwords that users reset back to a known state.\\\\n-\\\\n-The following sample PowerShell script generates a random password of 64 characters and sets it for the user specified in the variable name **$samAccountName** against on-premises AD DS domain.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Microsoft Entra Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities. For example, over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions. It deepens the Zero Trust security strategy by augmenting the least privilege access principle.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What are the prerequisites to use Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management supports data collection from AWS, GCP, and/or Microsoft Azure. For data collection and analysis, customers are required to have a Microsoft Entra account to use Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='can-a-customer-use-permissions-management-if-they-have-other-identities-with-access-to-their-iaas-platform-that-arent-yet-in-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can a customer use Permissions Management if they have other identities with access to their IaaS platform that aren't yet in Microsoft Entra ID?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, a customer can detect, mitigate, and monitor the risk for AWS IAM or GCP accounts, or from other identity providers such as Okta or AWS IAM.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Where can customers access Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers can access the Permissions Management interface from the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) .\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can noncloud customers use Permissions Management on-premises?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management is a hosted cloud offering.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can non-Azure customers use Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, non-Azure customers can use our solution. Permissions Management is a multicloud solution so even customers who have no subscription to Azure can benefit from it.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU)?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, Permissions Management is currently for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='if-im-already-using-azure-ad--privileged-identity-management-pim-for-azure-what-value-does-permissions-management-provide'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## If I'm already using Microsoft Entra ID  Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure, what value does Permissions Management provide?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management complements Microsoft Entra PIM. Microsoft Entra PIM provides just-in-time access for admin roles in Azure and Microsoft Online Services and apps that use groups. Permissions Management allows multicloud discovery, remediation, and monitoring of privileged access across Azure, AWS, and GCP.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What public cloud infrastructures does Permissions Management support?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management currently supports the three major public clouds: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Does Permissions Management support hybrid environments?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management currently doesn't support hybrid environments.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What types of identities does Permissions Management support?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management supports user identities (for example, employees, customers, external partners) and workload identities (for example, virtual machines, containers, web apps, serverless functions).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management available in Government Cloud?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management is currently not available in Government clouds.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management available for sovereign clouds?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management is currently not available in sovereign Clouds.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How does Permissions Management collect insights about permissions usage?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management has a data collector that collects access permissions that are assigned to various identities, activity logs, and resources metadata. The data collector provides full visibility into permissions granted to all identities to access the resources and details on usage of granted permissions.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How does Permissions Management evaluate cloud permissions risk?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management offers granular visibility into all identities and their permissions granted versus used, across cloud infrastructures to uncover any action performed by any identity on any resource. The visibility isn't limited to just user identities, but also workload identities such as virtual machines, access keys, containers, and scripts. The dashboard gives an overview of permission profile to locate the riskiest identities and resources.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What is the Permissions Creep Index?\\\\n-\\\\n-The Permissions Creep Index (PCI) is a quantitative measure of risk associated with an identity or role determined by comparing permissions granted versus permissions exercised. It allows users to instantly evaluate the level of risk associated with the number of unused or over-provisioned permissions across identities and resources. It measures how much damage identities can cause based on the permissions they have.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How can customers use Permissions Management to delete unused or excessive permissions?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management allows users to right-size excessive permissions and automate least privilege policy enforcement with just a few clicks. The solution continuously analyzes historical permission usage data for each identity and gives customers the ability to right-size the permissions of that identity to permissions that are only being used for day-to-day operations. All unused and other risky permissions can be automatically removed.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Why is a user I deleted still visible in the Analytics tab?\\\\n-\\\\n-Check to see if the user was assigned a *Classic Administrator* role. Classic admin roles don't go away when a user is deleted. To resolve this, go to the [Classic admin page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268264) and delete that role assignment separately for the user.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How can customers grant permissions on-demand with Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-For any break-glass or one-off scenarios where an identity needs to perform a specific set of actions on a set of specific resources, the identity can request those permissions on-demand for a limited period with a self-service workflow. Customers can either use the built-in workflow engine or their IT service management (ITSM) tool. The user experience is the same for any identity type, identity source (local, enterprise directory, or federated) and cloud.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What is the difference between permissions on-demand and just-in-time access?\\\\n-\\\\n-Just-in-time (JIT) access is a method used to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure identities are given the minimum level of permissions to perform the task at hand. Permissions on-demand are a type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How can customers monitor permissions usage with Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers only need to track the evolution of their Permission Creep Index (PCI) to monitor permissions usage. Customers can monitor PCI in the **Analytics** tab from their Permissions Management dashboard.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can customers generate permissions usage reports?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, Permissions Management has various types of system report available that capture specific data sets. These reports allow customers to:\\\\n-- Make timely decisions.\\\\n-- Analyze usage trends and system/user performance.\\\\n-- Identify high-risk areas.\\\\n-\\\\n-For information about permissions usage reports, see [Generate and download the Permissions analytics report](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Does Permissions Management integrate with third-party ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) tools?\\\\n-\\\\n-Integration with ITSM tools, such as ServiceNow, is in the future roadmap.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How is Permissions Management being deployed?\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers assigned the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role must first onboard Permissions Management to their Microsoft Entra tenant, and then onboard their AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions. More details about onboarding can be found in our [product documentation](onboard-enable-tenant.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## How long does it take to deploy Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-It depends on each customer and how many AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions they have.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Once Permissions Management is deployed, how fast can I get permissions insights?\\\\n-\\\\n-Once fully onboarded with data collection setup, customers can access permissions usage insights within hours. Our machine-learning engine refreshes the Permission Creep Index every hour so that customers can start their risk assessment right away.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management collecting and storing sensitive personal data?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management doesn't have access to sensitive personal data.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Where can I find more information about Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-You can read our [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity) and visit our [web page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management). You can also get in touch with your Microsoft point of contact to schedule a demo.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What is the data destruction/decommission process?\\\\n-\\\\n-If a customer initiates a free Permissions Management 45-day trial and does not convert to a paid license within 45 days of the trial expiration, all collected data is deleted within 30 days of the trial expiration date.  \\\\n-\\\\n-If a customer decides to discontinue licensing the service, all previously collected data is deleted within 30 days of license termination.\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers can also remove, export or modify specific data if a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) using the Permissions Management service files an official Data Subject Request. To file a request:\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're an enterprise customer, you can contact your Microsoft representative, account team, or tenant admin to file a high-priority IcM support ticket requesting a Data Subject Request. Do not include details or any personally identifiable information in the IcM request. We'll reach out to you for these details only after an IcM is filed.\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're a self-service customer (you set up a trial or paid license in the Microsoft 365 admin center) you can contact the Permissions Management privacy team by selecting your profile drop-down menu, then **Account Settings** in Permissions Management. Follow the instructions to make a Data Subject Request.\\\\n-\\\\n-Learn more about [Azure Data Subject Requests](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2245178).\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='do-i-require-a-license-to-use-entra-permissions-management-'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Do I require a license to use Microsoft Entra Permissions Management? \\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, as of July 1, 2022, new customers must acquire a free 45-day trial license or a paid license to use the service. You can enable a trial here: [https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement](https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement) or you can directly purchase resource-based licenses here: [https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement](https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement) \\\\n-\\\\n-## How is Permissions Management priced? \\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management is $125 per resources/year ($10.40 per resource/month). Permissions Management requires licenses for workloads, which include any resource that uses compute or memory. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Do I need to pay for all resources?\\\\n-\\\\n-Although Permissions Management supports all resources, Microsoft only requires licenses for billable resources per cloud environment. To learn more about billable resources, visit [View billable resources listed in your authorization system](product-data-billable-resources.md)\\\\n-\\\\n-## How do I calculate the number of billable resources I have? \\\\n-\\\\n-To calculate the billable resources you have across your multicloud infrastructure, you must first activate a [45-day free trial](https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement) of Permissions Management or [purchase a paid license](https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement). In Permissions Management, select **Settings** (gear icon), then click the **Billable Resources** tab. View the amount of billable resources in the **Total Number of Licenses** column.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What do I do if I’m using the legacy version of the CloudKnox service?  \\\\n-\\\\n-We are currently working on developing a migration plan to help customers on the original CloudKnox service move to the new Microsoft Entra Permissions Management service later in 2022.   \\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='can-i-use-entra-permissions-management-in-the-eu--'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can I use Microsoft Entra Permissions Management in the EU?  \\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, the product is compliant.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## How to I enable one of the new 18 languages supported in the GA release? \\\\n-\\\\n-We are now localized in 18 languages.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer who uses the AWS IAM Identity Center, you can configure the Identity Center as an identity provider in Permissions Management. Configuring your AWS IAM Identity Center information allows you to receive more accurate data for your identities in Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Configuring AWS IAM Identity Center as an identity provider is an optional step. By configuring identity provider information, Permissions Management can read user and role access configured at AWS IAM Identity Center. Admins can see the augmented view of assigned permissions to the identities. You can return to these steps to configure an IdP at any time.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How to configure AWS IAM Identity Center as an identity provider\\\\n-\\\\n-1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches, select **Settings** (gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-2. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **AWS**, and then select **Create Configuration**. If a Data Collector already exists in your AWS account and you want to add AWS IAM integration, then: \\\\n-    - Select the Data Collector for which you want to configure AWS IAM. \\\\n-    - Click on the ellipsis next to the **Authorization Systems Status**. \\\\n-    - Select **Integrate Identity Provider**. \\\\n-\\\\n-3. On the **Integrate Identity provider (IdP)** page, select the box for **AWS IAM Identity Center**. \\\\n-\\\\n-4. Fill in the following fields:\\\\n-    - The **AWS IAM Identity Center Region**. Specify the region where AWS IAM Identity Center is installed. All data configured in the IAM Identity Center  \\\\n-    is stored in the Region where the IAM Identity Center is installed.   \\\\n-    - Your **AWS Management Account ID**\\\\n-    - Your **AWS Management Account Role**\\\\n-\\\\n-5. Select **Launch Management Account Template**. The template opens in a new window. \\\\n-6. If the Management Account stack is created with the CloudFormation Template as part of the previous onboarding steps, update the stack by running ``EnableSSO`` as true. Running this command creates a new stack when running the Management Account Template. \\\\n-\\\\n-The template execution attaches the AWS managed policy  ``AWSSSOReadOnly`` and the newly created custom policy ``SSOPolicy`` to the AWS IAM role that allows Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to collect organizational information. The following details are requested in the template.

Custom RegEx expression for group syntax is not supported.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How to configure Okta as an identity provider\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Log in to the Okta portal with API Access Management Administrator. \\\\n-2. Create a new **Okta API Services Application**. \\\\n-3. In the Admin Console, go to Applications. \\\\n-4. On the Create a new app integration page, select **API Services**.\\\\n-5. Enter a name for your app integration and click **Save**. \\\\n-6. Copy the **Client ID** for future use.  \\\\n-7. In the **Client Credentials** section of the General tab, click **Edit** to change the client authentication method. \\\\n-8. Select **Public key/Private key** as the Client authentication method. \\\\n-9. Leave the default **Save keys in Okta**, then click **Add key**. \\\\n-10. Click **Add** and in the **Add a public key** dialog, either paste your own public key or click **Generate new key** to autogenerate a new 2048-bit RSA key. \\\\n-11. Copy **Public Key Id** for future use.  \\\\n-12. Click **Generate new key** and the public and private keys appear in JWK format. \\\\n-13. Click **PEM**. The private key appears in PEM format. \\\\n-    This is your only opportunity to save the private key. Click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the private key and store it somewhere safe. \\\\n-14. Click **Done**. The new public key is now registered with the app and appears in a table in the **PUBLIC KEYS** section of the **General** tab. \\\\n-15. From the Okta API scopes tab, grant these scopes:\\\\n-    - okta.users.read\\\\n-    - okta.groups.read\\\\n-    - okta.apps.read\\\\n-16. Optional. Click the **Application rate limits** tab to adjust the rate-limit capacity percentage for this service application. By default, each new application sets this percentage at 50 percent. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Convert public key to a Base64 string\\\\n-\\\\n-1. See instructions for [using a personal access token (PAT)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249174).\\\\n-\\\\n-### Find your Okta URL (also called an Okta domain)\\\\n-\\\\n-This Okta URL/Okta domain is saved in the AWS secret.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.\\\\n-2. Look for the Okta URL/Okta domain in the global header of the dashboard. \\\\n-Once located, note the Okta URL in an app such as Notepad. You'll need this URL for your next steps. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Configure AWS stack details\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Fill in the following fields on the **CloudFormation Template Specify stack details** screen using the information from your Okta application:\\\\n-    - **Stack name** - A name of our choosing\\\\n-    - **Or URL** Your organization's Okta URL, example: *https://companyname.okta.com*\\\\n-    - **Client Id** - From the **Client Credentials** section of your Okta application\\\\n-    - **Public Key Id** - Click **Add > Generate new key**. The public key is generated \\\\n-    - **Private Key (in PEM format)** - Base64 encoded string of the PEM format of the **Private key**\\\\n-     > [!NOTE]\\\\n-     > You must copy all text in the field before converting to a Base64 string, including the dash before BEGIN PRIVATE KEY and after END PRIVATE KEY.\\\\n-2. When the **CloudFormation Template Specify stack details** screen is complete, click **Next**.\\\\n-3. On the **Configure stack options** screen, click **Next**.\\\\n-4. Review the information you've entered, then click **Submit**.\\\\n-5. Select the **Resources** tab, then copy the **Physical ID** (this ID is the Secret ARN) for future use.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Configure Okta in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Integrating Okta as an identity provider is an optional step. You can return to these steps to configure an IdP at any time. \\\\n-\\\\n-1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches, select **Settings** (gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.\\\\n-2. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **AWS**, and then select **Create Configuration**.\\\\n-    Complete the **Manage Authorization System** steps.\\\\n-    > [!NOTE]\\\\n-    > If a Data Collector already exists in your AWS account and you want to add Okta integration, follow these steps:\\\\n-    >  1. Select the Data Collector for which you want to add Okta integration.\\\\n-    >  1. Click on the ellipsis next to the **Authorization System Status**.\\\\n-    >  1. Select **Integrate Identity Provider**.\\\\n-\\\\n-3. On the **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page, select the box for **Okta**.\\\\n-4. Select **Launch CloudFormation Template**. The template opens in a new window.\\\\n-   > [!NOTE]\\\\n-   > Here you'll fill in information to create a secret Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that you'll enter on the **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page. Microsoft does not read or store this ARN.\\\\n-5. Return to the Permissions Management **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page and paste the **Secret ARN** in the field provided.\\\\n-6. Click **Next** to review and confirm the information you've entered.\\\\n-7. Click **Verify Now & Save**.\\\\n-   The system returns the populated AWS CloudFormation Template. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- For information on how to view existing roles/policies, requests, and permissions, see [View roles/policies, requests, and permission in the Remediation dashboard](ui-remediation.md).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"92fa931761eb202a1b4a51c1b2936a8fa0e154b4\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/how-to-configure-servicenow-application.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 62,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 62,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fhow-to-configure-servicenow-application.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fhow-to-configure-servicenow-application.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fhow-to-configure-servicenow-application.md?ref=446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,62 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: Configure the ServiceNow application with Permissions Management\\\\n-description: How to configure ServiceNow with Microsoft Entra Permissions Management.\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n-ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n-ms.custom: sfi-image-nochange\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Configure the ServiceNow app for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on November 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire). \\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is retiring on October 01, 2025, with new purchases unavailable starting April 1, 2025. Existing paid customers will continue to have access to Permissions Management between April 1, 2025 - September 30, 2025. \\\\n-\\\\n-On October 01, 2025, Permissions Management will be automatically offboarded and associated data collection will be deleted. For customers needing to offboard before October 1, 2025, refer to the [Offboarding steps](#offboarding-steps) section in this guide. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Why is Permissions Management being retired? \\\\n-\\\\n-The decision to phase out Microsoft Entra Permissions Management from the Microsoft Security portfolio was made after deep consideration of our innovation portfolio and how we can focus on delivering the best innovations aligned to our differentiating areas and partners with the ecosystem on adjacencies. We remain committed to delivering top-tier solutions across the Microsoft Entra portfolio, which includes Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Suite (encompassing ID Protection, ID Governance, Verified ID, Internet Access, and Private Access), Microsoft Entra External ID, Microsoft Entra Workload ID, and more.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Recommended solutions\\\\n-\\\\n-Since Permissions Management is retiring, Microsoft recommends that customers who have onboarded the product in their environment start planning for transition. Customers who are not onboarded should refrain from onboarding.   \\\\n-\\\\n-To support this transition, Microsoft is partnering with [Delinea](https://delinea.com/). Delinea offers a cloud-native, fully Microsoft-compatible Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) solution, Privilege Control for Cloud Entitlements (PCCE). PCCE provides functionality comparable to Permissions Management, including continuous discovery of entitlements that allow you to monitor and adjust access rights for both human and machine identities.  \\\\n-\\\\n-We recommend beginning the shift away from Permissions Management as soon as possible, well before September 30th. We're committed to providing extensive support, alongside our partner, Delinea.  \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Recommended steps before migrating to Delinea\\\\n-\\\\n-To ensure you continue with the CIEM objectives with our recommended partner, we recommend making a note of the following information from your Permissions Management portal: \\\\n-\\\\n-- First, go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview), then click **Permissions Management** from the navigation blade. \\\\n-\\\\n-    - Authorization system IDs which are being monitored across Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Settings (Gear icon)** and select the **Authorization Systems** tab to view list of Authorization system IDs.  \\\\n-    - Groups and users given admin access with the Permissions Management Administrator role in Entra ID. To find this, launch **Entra ID**, select **Roles and Admins**, search for **Permissions Management Administrator role**, select **Assignments**. \\\\n-    - Authorization system-specific access provided to groups through the Permissions Management portal. To find this, launch **Permissions Management** portal, Select **User Management**, then click the **Groups** tab to view all group assignments.  \\\\n-    - Custom reports configured in your environment. To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Reports**, navigate to **Custom Reports**.\\\\n-    - Alerts configured in your environment. To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Alerts** (bell icon), navigate to respective alerts tab.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Offboarding steps\\\\n-\\\\n-Once onboarded to our recommended partner and/or any other vendor, customers can initiate offboarding. Follow these steps in order:  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Remove permissions assigned in AWS, Azure, and GCP.\\\\n-1. Remove the OIDC application for AWS and GCP environments.\\\\n-1. Stop collecting data for your entire list of accounts / subscriptions/ projects by deleting the associated data collectors: This ensures no new data is collected and you'll no longer have access to any historic data.\\\\n-1. Disable user sign-in to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) enterprise application   \\\\n-\\\\n- Continue for detailed guidelines for each of these steps.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Remove permissions assigned in AWS, Azure, and GCP\\\\n-\\\\n-For successful offboarding of your data, remove permissions from your onboarded cloud provider (Azure, AWS, or GCP) and Permissions Management. Any roles and permissions assigned during onboarding should be removed. This ensures your environment is secure with no overprivileged access once your environment is offboarded from Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-Refer to the Data Collector configuration from the Permissions Management portal and select the settings (gear icon). Note down the configuration settings to remove roles and permissions assigned in your respective cloud provider.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## Remove the OIDC application for AWS and GCP environments\\\\n-\\\\n-For AWS and GCP, delete the application created in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center tenant where Permissions Management is enabled. This app was used to set up an OIDC (OpenID Connect) connection to your AWS and GCP environments.   \\\\n-\\\\n-To find the Enterprise Application created which was used to set up OIDC connection to your AWS and GCP environments, follow the below steps: \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE] \\\\n-> User must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) and [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator) role assignments to perform this task. \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n-1. Launch the **Permissions Management** portal.\\\\n-1. Select **Settings** (gear icon), then select the **Data Collectors** tab.\\\\n-1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select your authorization system type:\\\\n-    - **AWS** for Amazon Web Services. \\\\n-    - **GCP** for Google Cloud Platform.\\\\n-1. Select the ellipses **(...)** at the end of the row in the table.\\\\n-1. Select **Edit Configuration**. The app is located under the **Azure App** name.\\\\n-1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n-1. Navigate to **Entra ID** > **App registrations**. \\\\n-1. Enter the name of the existing application in the search box, and then select the application from the search results.\\\\n-1. From the Overview page, select **Delete**. Read the deletion consequences. Check the box if one appears at the bottom of the pane.\\\\n-1.

GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |\\\\n-| Identity analytics    | Includes basic monitoring and remediation, dormant and orphan account detection and removal, and privileged account discovery. |\\\\n-| Identity lifecycle management | Maintain digital identities, their relationships with the organization, and their attributes during the entire process from creation to eventual archiving, using one or more identity life cycle patterns. |\\\\n-| IGA                   | Identity governance and administration. Technology solutions that conduct identity management and access governance operations. IGA includes the tools, technologies, reports, and compliance activities required for identity lifecycle management. It includes every operation from account creation and termination to user provisioning, access certification, and enterprise password management. It looks at automated workflow and data from authoritative sources capabilities, self-service user provisioning, IT governance, and password management. |\\\\n-| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |\\\\n-| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |\\\\n-| ITSM                     | Information Technology Security Management. Tools that enable IT operations organizations (infrastructure and operations managers), to better support the production environment. Facilitate the tasks and workflows associated with the management and delivery of quality IT services.      |\\\\n-| JEP | Just Enough Permissions |\\\\n-| JIT                    | Just in Time access can be seen as a way to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure users and non-human identities are given the minimum level of privileges. It also ensures that privileged activities are conducted in accordance with an organization's Identity Access Management (IAM), IT Service Management (ITSM), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) policies, with its entitlements and workflows. JIT access strategy enables organizations to maintain a full audit trail of privileged activities so they can easily identify who or what gained access to which systems, what they did at what time, and for how long.     |\\\\n-| Least privilege        | Ensures that users only gain access to the specific tools they need to complete a task.  |\\\\n-| Multi-tenant            | A single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database.                    |\\\\n-| OIDC                    | OpenID Connect. An authentication protocol that verifies user identity when a user is trying to access a protected HTTPS end point. OIDC is an evolutionary development of ideas implemented earlier in OAuth. |\\\\n-| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. | \\\\n-| PAM                   | Privileged access management. Tools that offer one or more of these features: discover, manage, and govern privileged accounts on multiple systems and applications; control access to privileged accounts, including shared and emergency access; randomize, manage, and vault credentials (password, keys, etc.) for administrative, service, and application accounts; single sign-on (SSO) for privileged access to prevent credentials from being revealed; control, filter, and orchestrate privileged commands, actions, and tasks; manage and broker credentials to applications, services, and devices to avoid exposure; and monitor, record, audit, and analyze privileged access, sessions, and actions. |\\\\n-| PASM                  | Privileged accounts are protected by vaulting their credentials. Access to those accounts is then brokered for human users, services, and applications. Privileged session management (PSM) functions establish sessions with possible credential injection and full session recording. Passwords and other credentials for privileged accounts are actively managed and changed at definable intervals or upon the occurrence of specific events. PASM solutions may also provide application-to-application password management (AAPM) and zero-install remote privileged access features for IT staff and third parties that don't require a VPN.  |\\\\n-| PEDM                  | Specific privileges are granted on the managed system by host-based agents to logged-in users. PEDM tools provide host-based command control (filtering); application allow, deny, and isolate controls; and/or privilege elevation. The latter is in the form of allowing particular commands to be run with a higher level of privileges. PEDM tools execute on the actual operating system at the kernel or process level. Command control through protocol filtering is explicitly excluded from this definition because the point of control is less reliable. PEDM tools may also provide file integrity monitoring features. |\\\\n-| Permission            | Rights and privileges. An action an identity can perform on a resource. Details given by users or network administrators that define access rights to files on a network. Access controls attached to a resource dictating which identities can access it and how. Permissions are attached to identities and are the ability to perform certain actions. |\\\\n-| POD                    | Permission on Demand. A type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.      |\\\\n-| Permissions creep index (PCI)    | A number from 0 to 100 that represents the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. PCI is a function of users who have access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them.    |\\\\n-| Policy and role management | Maintain rules that govern automatic assignment and removal of access rights. Provides visibility of access rights for selection in access requests, approval processes, dependencies, and incompatibilities between access rights, and more. Roles are a common vehicle for policy management. |\\\\n-| Privilege             | The authority to make changes to a network or computer. Both people and accounts can have privileges, and both can have different levels of privilege.        |\\\\n-| Privileged account    | A login credential to a server, firewall, or other administrative account. Often referred to as admin accounts. Comprised of the actual username and password; these two things together make up the account. A privileged account is allowed to do more things than a normal account. |\\\\n-| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |\\\\n-| Public Cloud            | Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.                |\\\\n-| Resource              | Any entity that uses compute capabilities can be accessed by users and services to perform actions. |\\\\n-| Role                    | An IAM identity that has specific permissions. Instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. A role doesn't have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with.                  |\\\\n-| SCIM                    | System for Cross–domain Identity Management |\\\\n-| SIEM                    | Security Information and Event Management. Technology that supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through the collection and analysis (both near real time and historical) of security events, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources. The core capabilities are a broad scope of log event collection and management, the ability to analyze log events and other data across disparate sources, and operational capabilities (such as incident management, dashboards, and reporting).      |\\\\n-| SOAR                  | Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR). Technologies that enable organizations to take inputs from various sources (mostly from security information and event management [SIEM] systems) and apply workflows aligned to processes and procedures. These workflows can be orchestrated via integrations with other technologies and automated to achieve the desired outcome and greater visibility. Other capabilities include case and incident management features; the ability to manage threat intelligence, dashboards and reporting; and analytics that can be applied across various functions. SOAR tools significantly enhance security operations activities like threat detection and response by providing machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes.    |\\\\n-| Super user / Super identity     | A powerful account used by IT system administrators that can be used to make configurations to a system or application, add or remove users, or delete data. Super users and identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account).   |\\\\n-| Tenant                | A dedicated instance of the services and organization data stored within a specific default location.                  |\\\\n-| UUID                    | Universally unique identifier. A 128-bit label used for information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used.|\\\\n-| Used permissions | The number of permissions used by an identity in the last 90 days. |\\\\n-| Zero trust security    | The three foundational principles: explicit verification, breach assumption, and least privileged access.|\\\\n-| ZTNA                   | Zero trust network access. A product or service that creates an identity- and context-based, logical access boundary around an application or set of applications. The applications are hidden from discovery, and access is restricted via a trust broker to a set of named entities. The broker verifies the identity, context and policy adherence of the specified participants before allowing access and prohibits lateral movement elsewhere in the network. It removes application assets from public visibility and significantly reduces the surface area for attack.|\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- For an overview of Permissions Management, see [What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?](overview.md).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"af1b80b842357a5f2edabf14e24b8daaa1830832\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/onboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 109,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 109,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md?ref=446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,109 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: Add an account/subscription/project to Permissions Management after onboarding is complete\\\\n-description: How to add an account/subscription/project to Permissions Management after onboarding is complete.\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n-\\\\n-ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Add an account/ subscription/ project after onboarding is complete\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on November 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

These entities are listed in the **Resources** tab of your CloudFormation stack.\\\\n-\\\\n-1.  Return to Permissions Management, and in **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Management Account Details**, select **Next**.\\\\n-\\\\n-### 4. Set up the AWS Central logging account connection (Optional but recommended)\\\\n-\\\\n-1. If your organization has a central logging account where logs from some or all of your AWS account are stored, in the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Central Logging Account Details** page, set up the logging account connection.\\\\n-\\\\n-    In the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Central Logging Account Details** page, enter the **Logging Account ID** and **Logging Account Role**.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In another browser window, sign in to the AWS console for the AWS account you use for central logging.\\\\n-\\\\n-1.  Return to Permissions Management, and in the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Central Logging Account Details** page, select **Launch Template**.\\\\n-\\\\n-    The **AWS CloudFormation create stack** page opens, displaying the template.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Review the information in the template, make changes, if necessary, then scroll to the bottom of the page.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the **Capabilities** box, select **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names**, and then select **Create stack**.\\\\n-\\\\n-    This AWS CloudFormation stack creates a role in the logging account with the necessary permissions (policies) to read S3 buckets used for central logging. A trust policy is set on this role to allow the OIDC role created in your AWS OIDC account to access it. These entities are listed in the **Resources** tab of your CloudFormation stack.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Return to Permissions Management, and in the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Central Logging Account Details** page, select **Next**.\\\\n-\\\\n-### 5. Set up an AWS member account\\\\n-\\\\n-Select **Enable AWS SSO checkbox**, if the AWS account access is configured through AWS SSO. \\\\n-\\\\n-Choose from three options to manage AWS accounts. \\\\n-\\\\n-#### Option 1: Automatically manage \\\\n-\\\\n-Choose this option to automatically detect and add to the monitored account list, without extra configuration. Steps to detect list of accounts and onboard for collection: \\\\n-\\\\n-- Deploy Management account CFT (Cloudformation template) which creates organization account role that grants permission to OIDC role created earlier to list accounts, OUs and SCPs. \\\\n-- If AWS SSO is enabled, organization account CFT also adds policy needed to collect AWS SSO configuration details. \\\\n-- Deploy Member account CFT in all the accounts that need to be monitored by Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. These actions create a cross account role that trusts the OIDC role created earlier. The SecurityAudit policy is attached to the role created for data collection. \\\\n-\\\\n-Any current or future accounts found get onboarded automatically. \\\\n-\\\\n-To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n-\\\\n-- Go to **Data Collectors** tab.  \\\\n-- Click on the status of the data collector.  \\\\n-- View accounts on the **In Progress** page \\\\n-\\\\n-#### Option 2: Enter authorization systems\\\\n-1.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-This article describes how to onboard a Microsoft Azure subscription or subscriptions on Permissions Management. Onboarding a subscription creates a new authorization system to represent the Azure subscription in Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> You must be a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) to perform the tasks in this article.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Explanation\\\\n-\\\\n-The Permissions Management service is built on Azure, and given you're onboarding your Azure subscriptions to be monitored and managed, setup is simple with few moving parts to configure. Below is what is required to configure onboarding:\\\\n-\\\\n-* When your tenant is onboarded, an application is created in the tenant.\\\\n-* This app requires 'reader' permissions on the subscriptions\\\\n-* For controller functionality, the app requires 'User Access Administrator' to create and implement right-size roles\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-To add Permissions Management to your Microsoft Entra tenant:\\\\n-- You must have a Microsoft Entra user account and an Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) on your system, or an Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).\\\\n-- You must have **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission at the subscription or management group scope to perform these tasks. If you don't have this permission, you can ask someone who has this permission to perform these tasks for you.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How to onboard an Azure subscription\\\\n-\\\\n-1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches:\\\\n-\\\\n-    - In the Permissions Management home page, select **Settings** (the gear icon, top right), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **Azure**, and then select **Create Configuration**.\\\\n-\\\\n-### 1. Add Azure subscription details\\\\n-\\\\n-Choose from three options to manage Azure subscriptions. \\\\n-\\\\n-#### Option 1: Automatically manage \\\\n-\\\\n-This option lets subscriptions be automatically detected and monitored without further work required. A key benefit of automatic management is that any current or future subscriptions found are onboarded automatically. The steps to detect a list of subscriptions and onboard for collection are as follows:  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Firstly, grant Reader role to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application at management group or subscription scope. To do this:  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the EPM portal, left-click the cog on the top right-hand side.  \\\\n-1. Go to data collectors tab \\\\n-1. Ensure **Azure** is selected.\\\\n-1. Click **Create Configuration.**\\\\n-1. For onboarding mode, select **Automatically Manage.**\\\\n-\\\\n-    > [!NOTE]\\\\n-    > The steps listed on the screen outline how to create the role assignment for the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management application. This is performed manually in the Microsoft Entra ID console, or programmatically with PowerShell or the Azure CLI.\\\\n-\\\\n-- Once complete, Click **Verify Now & Save.**\\\\n-\\\\n-To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Collectors are now listed and change through status types. For each collector listed with a status of **Collected Inventory,** click on that status to view further information. \\\\n-1. You can then view subscriptions on the In Progress page.\\\\n-\\\\n-#### Option 2: Enter authorization systems \\\\n-\\\\n-You have the ability to specify only certain subscriptions to manage and monitor with Permissions Management (up to 100 per collector). Follow the steps below to configure these subscriptions to be monitored: \\\\n-\\\\n-1. For each subscription you wish to manage, ensure that the ‘Reader’ role has been granted to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application for the subscription. \\\\n-1. In the EPM portal, click the cog on the top right-hand side. \\\\n-1. Go to data collectors tab \\\\n-1. Ensure 'Azure' is selected\\\\n-1. Click ‘Create Configuration’ \\\\n-1. Select ‘Enter Authorization Systems’ \\\\n-1. Under the Subscription IDs section, enter a desired subscription ID into the input box. Click the “+” up to nine extra times, putting a single subscription ID into each respective input box. \\\\n-1. Once you have input all of the desired subscriptions, click next \\\\n-1. Click ‘Verify Now & Save’ \\\\n-1. Once the access to read and collect data is verified, collection will begin. \\\\n-\\\\n-To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Go to the **Data Collectors** tab.  \\\\n-1. Click on the status of the data collector.  \\\\n-1. View subscriptions on the In Progress page.\\\\n-\\\\n-#### Option 3: Select authorization systems \\\\n-\\\\n-This option detects all subscriptions that are accessible by the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application.  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Firstly, grant Reader role to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application at management group or subscription scope.  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the Permissions Management portal, click the cog on the top right-hand side.  \\\\n-1. Go to the **Data Collectors** tab.\\\\n-1. Ensure **Azure** is selected.\\\\n-1.

Go to newly create Data Collector row under Azure data collectors. \\\\n-1. Click on Status column when the row has **Pending** status \\\\n-1. To onboard and start collection, choose specific ones subscriptions from the detected list and consent for collection.\\\\n-\\\\n-### 2. Review and save.\\\\n-\\\\n-1.

CIEM is a critical component of a Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) solution providing visibility into who has access to what resources and ensuring access rights align with the principle of least privilege (PoLP), where users have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks.  \\\\n- \\\\n-Microsoft delivers both CNAPP and CIEM solutions with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CNAPP) and Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (CIEM). While both Defender for Cloud and Permissions Management help secure customers’ cloud environments, they're two distinct security solutions that address different aspects of cloud security. Permissions Management focuses on managing and enforcing fine-grained access controls, permissions, and entitlements for identities across multicloud infrastructures. Defender for Cloud focuses on securing cloud-native applications such as containers, microservices, and serverless applications through visibility into application behavior and security posture.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## How Permissions Management works with Defender for Cloud\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management capabilities are available to integrate into the Defender for Cloud CSPM plan. Adding the capabilities of Permissions Management to Defender for Cloud strengthens the prevention of security breaches that might occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. These added features make Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Permissions Management and Defender for Cloud capabilities\\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud/permissions-management-defender-for-cloud-comparison.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A table showing the difference in capabilities of Permissions Management and Defender for Cloud.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud/permissions-management-defender-for-cloud-comparison.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Common use cases and scenarios\\\\n-\\\\n-With the added capabilities of Permissions Management, you can track permissions analytics, unused permissions for active identities, and over-permissioned identities then act to mitigate them to support the best practice of least privilege in Defender for Cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- For instructions on how to enable Permissions Management in your Defender for Cloud environment, see [Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252561).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"f9609afd3b709a628c08f8130560ed9f69fed9e7\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/permissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 196,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 196,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md?ref=446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,196 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: Microsoft Entra Permissions Management Quickstart Guide\\\\n-description: Quickstart guide - How to quickly onboard your Microsoft Entra Permissions Management product\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n-ms.topic: quickstart\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n-ms.custom: sfi-image-nochange\\\\n-# CustomerIntent: As a security administrator, I want to successfully onboard Permissions Management so that I can enable identity security in my cloud environment as efficiently as possible.'\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Quickstart guide to Microsoft Entra Permissions Management \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on November 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

Permissions Management helps your organization effectively secure and manage cloud permissions by detecting, automatically right-sizing, and continuously monitoring unused and excessive permissions. \\\\n-\\\\n-With this quickstart guide, you’ll set up your multicloud environment(s), configure data collection, and enable permissions access to ensure your cloud identities are managed and secure.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites \\\\n-\\\\n-Before you begin, you need access to these tools for the onboarding process: \\\\n-\\\\n-- Access to a local BASH shell with the Azure CLI or Azure Cloud Shell using BASH environment (Azure CLI is included). \\\\n-- Access to AWS, Azure, and GCP consoles.\\\\n-- A user must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to create a new app registration in Microsoft Entra tenant is required for AWS and GCP onboarding. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 1: Set-up Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-To enable Permissions Management, you must have a Microsoft Entra tenant (example, Microsoft Entra admin center).  \\\\n-- If you have an Azure account, you automatically have a Microsoft Entra admin center tenant. \\\\n-- If you don’t already have one, create a free account at [entra.microsoft.com.](https://entra.microsoft.com)\\\\n-\\\\n-If the above points are met, continue with:\\\\n-\\\\n-[Enable Microsoft Entra Permissions Management in your organization](onboard-enable-tenant.md)\\\\n-\\\\n-Ensure you're a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator). Learn more about [Permissions Management roles and permissions](product-roles-permissions.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-roles-sync-azure-environment.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A diagram showing where Microsoft Entra intersect with Azure roles in the Microsoft Entra tenant.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-roles-sync-azure-environment.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n- \\\\n-## Step 2: Onboard your multicloud environment\\\\n-\\\\n-So far you’ve,  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Been assigned the *Permissions Management Administrator* role in your Microsoft Entra admin center tenant. \\\\n-2. Purchased licenses or activated your 45-day free trial for Permissions Management. \\\\n-3. Successfully launched Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-Now, you're going to learn about the role and settings of the Controller and Data collection modes in Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Set the controller \\\\n-The controller gives you the choice to determine the level of access you grant to users in Permissions Management.  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Enabling the controller during onboarding grants Permissions Management admin access, or read and write access, so users can right-size permissions and remediate directly through Permissions Management (instead of going to the AWS, Azure, or GCP consoles).  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Disabling the controller during onboarding, or never enabling it, grants a Permissions Management user read-only access to your environment(s).  \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> If you don't enable the controller during onboarding, you have the option to enable it after onboarding is complete. To set the controller in Permissions Management after onboarding, see [Enable or disable the controller after onboarding](onboard-enable-controller-after-onboarding.md).\\\\n-> For AWS environments, once you have enabled the controller, you *cannot* disable it. \\\\n-\\\\n-To set the controller settings during onboarding:\\\\n-1. Select **Enable** to give read and write access to Permissions Management.\\\\n-2. Select **Disable** to give read-only access to Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Configure data collection\\\\n-\\\\n-There are three modes to choose from in order to collect data in Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-- **Automatic (recommended)** \\\\n-Permissions Management automatically discovers, onboards, and monitors all current and future subscriptions. \\\\n-\\\\n-- **Manual** \\\\n-Manually enter individual subscriptions for Permissions Management to discover, onboard, and monitor. You can enter up to 100 subscriptions per data collection.  \\\\n-\\\\n-- **Select** \\\\n-Permissions Management automatically discovers all current subscriptions. Once discovered, you select which subscriptions to onboard and monitor. \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE] \\\\n-> To use **Automatic** or **Select** modes, the controller must be enabled while configuring data collection. \\\\n-\\\\n-To configure data collection:\\\\n-1. In Permissions Management, go to the **Data Collectors** page.\\\\n-2. Select a cloud environment: **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**.\\\\n-3. Click **Create configuration**.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The data collection process takes some time and occurs in approximately 4-5 hour intervals in most cases. The time frame depends on the size of the authorization system you have and how much data is available for collection.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### Onboard Amazon Web Services (AWS)\\\\n-Since Permissions Management is hosted on Microsoft Entra, there are more steps to take to onboard your AWS environment.  \\\\n-\\\\n-To connect AWS to Permissions Management, you must create a Microsoft Entra application in the Microsoft Entra admin center tenant where Permissions Management is enabled. This Microsoft Entra application is used to set up an OIDC connection to your AWS environment.\\\\n-\\\\n-*OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications.*\\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-tenant-amazon-web-service-connection.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A diagram showing the connection between Microsoft Entra ID and an AWS cloud environment.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-tenant-amazon-web-service-connection.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### Prerequisites \\\\n-\\\\n-A user must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to create a new app registration in Microsoft Entra ID. \\\\n-\\\\n-Account IDs and roles for: \\\\n-- AWS OIDC account: An AWS member account designated by you to create and host the OIDC connection through an OIDC IdP\\\\n-- AWS Logging account (optional but recommended) \\\\n-- AWS Management account (optional but recommended)  \\\\n-- AWS member accounts monitored and managed by Permissions Management (for manual mode) \\\\n-\\\\n-To use **Automatic** or **Select** data collection modes, you must connect your AWS Management account.  \\\\n-\\\\n-During this step, you can enable the controller by entering the name of the S3 bucket with AWS CloudTrail activity logs (found on AWS Trails). \\\\n-\\\\n-To onboard your AWS environment and configure data collection, see [Onboard an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](onboard-aws.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-### Onboard Microsoft Azure\\\\n-When you enabled Permissions Management in the Microsoft Entra tenant, an enterprise application for CIEM was created. To onboard your Azure environment, you grant permissions to this application for Permissions management.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the Microsoft Entra tenant where Permissions management is enabled, locate the **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)** enterprise application.  \\\\n-\\\\n-2. Assign the *Reader* role to the CIEM application to allow Permissions management to read the Microsoft Entra subscriptions in your environment. \\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-tenant-role-connection-azure-subscriptions.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A diagram showing the connection between the Microsoft Entra role connections to an Azure subscription.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-tenant-role-connection-azure-subscriptions.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n-\\\\n-### Prerequisites \\\\n-- A user with ```Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write``` permissions at the subscription or management group scope to assign roles to the CIEM application.\\\\n-\\\\n-- To use **Automatic** or **Select** data collection modes, you must assign the *Reader* role at the Management group scope. \\\\n-\\\\n-- To enable the controller, you must assign the *User Access Administrator* role to the CIEM application. \\\\n-\\\\n-To onboard your Azure environment and configure data collection, see [Onboard a Microsoft Azure subscription](onboard-azure.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### Onboard Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\\\\n-Because Permissions Management is hosted on Microsoft Azure, there are additional steps to take to onboard your GCP environment.\\\\n-\\\\n-To connect GCP to Permissions Management, you must create a Microsoft Entra admin center application in the Microsoft Entra tenant where Permissions Management is enabled.

You have finished configuring data collection for your environment(s), and the data collection process has begun. The data collection process takes some time; approximately 4-5 hours in most cases. The time frame depends on the amount of authorization systems you've onboarded and how much data is available for collection.  \\\\n-\\\\n-The status column in your Permissions Management UI shows you which step of data collection you're at.  \\\\n-\\\\n- \\\\n-- **Pending**: Permissions Management has not started detecting or onboarding yet. \\\\n-- **Discovering**: Permissions Management is detecting the authorization systems. \\\\n-- **In progress**: Permissions Management has finished detecting the authorization systems and is onboarding. \\\\n-- **Onboarded**: Data collection is complete, and all detected authorization systems are onboarded to Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE] \\\\n-> While the data collection process continues, you can begin setting up [users and groups in Permissions Management](how-to-add-remove-user-to-group.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- [Enable or disable the controller after onboarding](onboard-enable-controller-after-onboarding.md)\\\\n-- [Add an account/subscription/project after onboarding is complete](onboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md)\\\\n-- [Create folders to organize your authorization systems](how-to-create-folders.md)\\\\n-\\\\n-References:\\\\n-- [Permissions Management Glossary](multi-cloud-glossary.md)\\\\n-- [Permissions Management FAQs](faqs.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"367463e85cc1727071ae285203d1c3230d1edf6c\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/product-account-explorer.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 79,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 79,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fproduct-account-explorer.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fproduct-account-explorer.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fproduct-account-explorer.md?ref=446cdc04b6fcc1b18c873488f029e3b613daa30a\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,79 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: View roles and identities that can access account information from an external account\\\\n-description: How to view information about identities that can access accounts from an external account in Permissions Management.\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management \\\\n-\\\\n-ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# View roles and identities that can access account information from an external account\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on November 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

There are different names and types of workload identities for each cloud. AWS: Lambda function (serverless function), role, resource. Azure: Azure function (serverless function), service principal. GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |\\\\n-| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |\\\\n-| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |\\\\n-| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. |  \\\\n-| Permission | A permission is an action an identity can perform on a resource. |\\\\n-| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |\\\\n-| Super identity | Super identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account). |\\\\n-| Used permissions | The number of permissions used by an identity in the last 90 days. |\\\\n-\\\\n-<!---## Add and remove tags in the Permissions analytics report\\\\n-\\\\n-1.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-This article provides the latest Public Preview and General Availability information of features in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-## May 2024\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration for Microsoft Defender for Cloud\\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become the norm. Ensuring the security of cloud applications and infrastructure requires integrating identity and permission insights into the overall security strategy. This objective is achieved through the integration of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management capabilities are available to integrate into the Defender for Cloud CSPM plan. Adding the capabilities of [Permissions Management to Defender for Cloud](permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud.md) strengthens the prevention of security breaches that might occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. These added features make Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-For instructions on how to enable Permissions Management in your Defender for Cloud environment, see [Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252561)\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - Support for PIM-enabled Groups \\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups in Microsoft Entra ID allows Permissions Management admins to grant users just-in-time membership and ownership of a security group or a Microsoft 365 group. Nested groups are also supported. For example, if a user is an active member of Group A, and Group A is an eligible member of Group B, the user can activate their membership in Group B. PIM provides a powerful mechanism to manage access and enhance security by granting just-in-time access to critical resources. \\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership along with existing support for direct group membership. It also solves the challenge of having visibility into who has access to what resource with eligible and direct role assignments. This feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways and the potential impact on Permissions Creep Index (PCI). A complete list of RBAC role assignments is provisioned directly, via the group membership or by an eligible group member, and can be seen per identity under the Analytics tab. \\\\n-\\\\n-## March 2024\\\\n-\\\\n-### Public Preview - Support for PIM-enabled Groups \\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-As multiple customers embrace PIM for groups as a popular feature, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership impact on the eligible granted Azure RBAC permissions and Permissions Creep Index (PCI). The feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways.  \\\\n- \\\\n-In the Permissions Management console, admins can see the membership eligibility status as well as role eligibility status for Groups. For each identity, admins can get the visibility into the membership eligibility status as well as roles eligibility status. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## December 2023\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - Permissions Analytics Report PDF\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-The [Permissions Analytics Report (PAR)](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). \\\\n-\\\\n-The PAR PDF is one part of the overall reporting redesign effort led by the engineering team. As part of this feature release, customers can download all reports (system or custom) with no row limitations in CSV and XSLX formats. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## October 2023\\\\n-\\\\n-### Public preview - Permissions Analytics Report PDF for multiple authorization systems\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                        \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management            \\\\n-\\\\n-The Permissions Analytics Report (PAR) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  \\\\n-\\\\n-The PAR PDF has a new design to enhance usability, align with the product UX redesign effort, and address various customer feature requests. [You can download the PAR PDF for up to 10 authorization systems](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - ServiceNow app for Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** New feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                        \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-The ServiceNow Application for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management enables users to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) through the ServiceNow portal. This integration aids organizations in enhancing their Zero Trust posture by enforcing the principle of least privilege for multicloud permissions. The ServiceNow app streamlines access permission requests within existing approval workflows.  \\\\n-\\\\n-Get the ServiceNow app in the [ServiceNow app store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/24073ae31bfca9100e564082b24bcb56/1.0.1?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%25253Bgenerative_ai%25253Bsnow_solution%26q%3Dentra%2520permissions%2520management&sl=sh). \\\\n-\\\\n-### Public preview - Okta and AWS Identity Center identity provider integrations\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** New feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                        \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management supports third party identity providers (IdP) integration to get more insight of single sign-on data of permissions assigned in cloud environments. With this information, Permissions Management can provide more accurate analytics. By reading role assignments and user data from the IdP side, Permissions Management more effectively calculates permissions granted, and as a result, reads more precise data on permissions creep. \\\\n-\\\\n-For [Okta Identity Provider integration](how-to-configure-okta-as-an-identity-provider.md), an admin needs to configure the API application to give the access to read Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. Permissions Management reads Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. \\\\n-\\\\n-For [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center integration](how-to-configure-aws-iam.md), an admin can provide Permissions Management access to read user and role access configuration data from the management account by running the CloudFormation template (CFT) in their AWS environment. After successful configuration, Permissions Management can read the data to calculate the analytics.\\\\n-\\\"\\r\\n  }\\r\\n].

This feature supports a gradual migration process, decreasing dependencies on AD while aiming to minimize user and operational impact. Both Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Cloud Sync recognize the SOA switch for these objects. The option to switch the SOA of synced users from AD to Microsoft Entra ID is currently available in Public Preview.

As workflows grow and change to meet the needs of members of your organization, so does the need to limit who can manage them. With delegated workflow management, you can scope management of workflows using [Administrative Units](../identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units.md).

Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Branding theme properties\\\\n+\\\\n+When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the sign-in page, with each of the default branding elements highlighted.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+| Property | Description |\\\\n+| --- | --- |\\\\n+| Favicon | Small icon that appears on the left side of the browser tab. |\\\\n+| Header | Space across the top of the sign-in page, behind the header log. |\\\\n+| Header logo | Logo that appears in the upper-left corner of the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Background image | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Page background color | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Banner logo | Logo that appears at the top of the sign-in box |\\\\n+| Sign-in page title | Larger text that appears below the banner logo. |\\\\n+| Sign-in page description | Text to describe the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Username hint and text | The text that appears before a user enters their information. |\\\\n+| Sign-in display message box | Text you can add below the username field. |\\\\n+| Footer link: Privacy & Cookies | Link you can add to the lower-right corner for privacy information. |\\\\n+| Footer: Terms of Use | Text in the lower-right corner of the page where you can add Terms of use information. |\\\\n+| Footer | Space across the bottom of the page for privacy and Terms of Use information. |\\\\n+| Template | The layout of the page and sign-in boxes. |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How branding themes work\\\\n+\\\\n+Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.\\\\n+- **Default branding (company branding)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.\\\\n+- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.\\\\n+- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.\\\\n+- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limits and constraints\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.\\\\n+\\\\n+- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.\\\\n+- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.\\\\n+- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.\\\\n+- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.\\\\n+- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name (neutral branding).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a new theme\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

This allows for unique sign-in experiences per application, overriding the default tenant-wide branding. The existing `how-to-customize-branding-customers.md` document has been updated to link to this new resource, and the table of contents (`toc.yml`) has been modified to include the new document under the \"Customize branding\" section for external identities.",

If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements are displayed.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article describes how you can create multiple branding themes for different applications in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Have at least the [Organizational Branding Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator) role.\\\\n+- Have at least the [Application Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role for applications that you want to apply a theme to.\\\\n+- A registered application in your tenant. If you haven't registered an application yet, see [Register an application](../../identity-platform/quickstart-register-app.md).\\\\n+- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Branding theme properties\\\\n+\\\\n+When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the sign-in page, with each of the default branding elements highlighted.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+| Property | Description |\\\\n+| --- | --- |\\\\n+| Favicon | Small icon that appears on the left side of the browser tab. |\\\\n+| Header | Space across the top of the sign-in page, behind the header log. |\\\\n+| Header logo | Logo that appears in the upper-left corner of the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Background image | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Page background color | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Banner logo | Logo that appears at the top of the sign-in box |\\\\n+| Sign-in page title | Larger text that appears below the banner logo. |\\\\n+| Sign-in page description | Text to describe the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Username hint and text | The text that appears before a user enters their information. |\\\\n+| Sign-in display message box | Text you can add below the username field. |\\\\n+| Footer link: Privacy & Cookies | Link you can add to the lower-right corner for privacy information. |\\\\n+| Footer: Terms of Use | Text in the lower-right corner of the page where you can add Terms of use information. |\\\\n+| Footer | Space across the bottom of the page for privacy and Terms of Use information. |\\\\n+| Template | The layout of the page and sign-in boxes. |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How branding themes work\\\\n+\\\\n+Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.\\\\n+- **Default branding (company branding)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.\\\\n+- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.\\\\n+- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.\\\\n+- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limits and constraints\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.\\\\n+\\\\n+- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.\\\\n+- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.\\\\n+- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.\\\\n+- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.\\\\n+- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name (neutral branding).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a new theme\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Additionally, the `toc.yml` file for the `external-id/customers` directory has been modified to include the new \"Branding themes\" section and link to the `how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps.md` article.

Select **Save**.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Custom attribute trigger considerations\\\\n+\\\\n+Currently the workflow and the workflow schedule must be enabled for attributes changes to be picked up and workflows executions to be scheduled. Once Lifecycle Workflows starts checking for attribute changes, the time it takes for changes to be picked up might be delayed for these custom attributes. While changes should be picked up within minutes, there are upstream processes that will add further delays after the user attribute changes, for example:\\\\n+- Custom attributes might take up to 4 hours for their changes to be updated by the underlying service, however, once the custom attributes changes are propagated, Lifecycle Workflows should pick up the change within seconds.\\\\n+- Once changes are picked up by Lifecycle workflows, workflow execution will occur in the next target run, according to the schedule for users that meet the workflow scope.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Attribute vs custom attribute processing timing\\\\n+\\\\n+The following image shows the potential differences in processing times for using regular attributes and custom attributes in the workflow trigger. \\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/workflow-custom-triggers/custom-attribute-timing.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of a comparison between regular and custom attribute processing timing in a workflow run.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+In example A, The workflow is scheduled to run when the department attribute changes, it's 12:00 pm and the next target runs are at 1pm and 2pm:\\\\n+- At 12:10pm, the user department changes\\\\n+- At 12:15 pm, the user is detected to be in scope of the workflow\\\\n+- In the 1pm run, the user gets processed by the workflow\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+In example B, Workflow is scheduled to run when the TestCustomSecurityAttribute1 attribute changes, it's 12:00 pm and the next target runs are at 1pm and 2pm:\\\\n+- At 12:10pm the TestCustomSecurityAttribute1 attribute changes for a user\\\\n+- At 3:55 pm the change is passed to Lifecycle Workflows\\\\n+- At 4:00 pm the user is detected to be in scope of the workflow (too late for the 4pm run)\\\\n+- In the 5pm run, the user gets processed by the workflow\\\\n+\\\\n+For frequently asked question about using custom attribute triggers within lifecycle workflows, see: [Lifecycle workflows FAQs](workflows-faqs.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Next step\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Lifecycle workflows execution conditions and scheduling](lifecycle-workflow-execution-conditions.md)\\\\n+- [Custom security attributes (CSA)](manage-workflow-custom-security-attribute.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"0e5988f299227186b01c36ae34054bdf60cf157b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/id-governance/workflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md?ref=03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -58,6 +58,23 @@ Lifecycle workflows checks that the user is assigned the custom security attribu\\\\n \\\\n If a user is assigned a custom security attribute that has multiple values, and one of the values matches the value in the specified in rule expressions, the user matches the scope.\\\\n \\\\n+### Why can’t I see the custom attributes listed in the attributes change trigger?\\\\n+\\\\n+To see the expected attributes in the drop down list, you need to ensure the following:\\\\n+\\\\n+- The attributes must be configured and active\\\\n+- For custom security attributes, you have the appropriate permissions\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Do workflows using custom attribute triggers always take 4 hours to process changes?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, the change processing time can vary depending on tenant change activity, timing and volume, with 4 hours expected to be the upper limit.

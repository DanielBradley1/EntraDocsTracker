More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n+\\\\n+This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Microsoft Entra Permissions Management.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities. For example, over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions. It deepens the Zero Trust security strategy by augmenting the least privilege access principle.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What are the prerequisites to use Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management supports data collection from AWS, GCP, and/or Microsoft Azure. For data collection and analysis, customers are required to have a Microsoft Entra account to use Permissions Management.\\\\n+\\\\n+<a name='can-a-customer-use-permissions-management-if-they-have-other-identities-with-access-to-their-iaas-platform-that-arent-yet-in-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n+\\\\n+## Can a customer use Permissions Management if they have other identities with access to their IaaS platform that aren't yet in Microsoft Entra ID?\\\\n+\\\\n+Yes, a customer can detect, mitigate, and monitor the risk for AWS IAM or GCP accounts, or from other identity providers such as Okta or AWS IAM.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Where can customers access Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+Customers can access the Permissions Management interface from the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) .\\\\n+\\\\n+## Can noncloud customers use Permissions Management on-premises?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, Permissions Management is a hosted cloud offering.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Can non-Azure customers use Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+Yes, non-Azure customers can use our solution. Permissions Management is a multicloud solution so even customers who have no subscription to Azure can benefit from it.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Is Permissions Management available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU)?\\\\n+\\\\n+Yes, Permissions Management is currently for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).\\\\n+\\\\n+<a name='if-im-already-using-azure-ad--privileged-identity-management-pim-for-azure-what-value-does-permissions-management-provide'></a>\\\\n+\\\\n+## If I'm already using Microsoft Entra ID  Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure, what value does Permissions Management provide?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management complements Microsoft Entra PIM. Microsoft Entra PIM provides just-in-time access for admin roles in Azure and Microsoft Online Services and apps that use groups. Permissions Management allows multicloud discovery, remediation, and monitoring of privileged access across Azure, AWS, and GCP.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What public cloud infrastructures does Permissions Management support?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management currently supports the three major public clouds: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Does Permissions Management support hybrid environments?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management currently doesn't support hybrid environments.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What types of identities does Permissions Management support?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management supports user identities (for example, employees, customers, external partners) and workload identities (for example, virtual machines, containers, web apps, serverless functions).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Is Permissions Management available in Government Cloud?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, Permissions Management is currently not available in Government clouds.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Is Permissions Management available for sovereign clouds?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, Permissions Management is currently not available in sovereign Clouds.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How does Permissions Management collect insights about permissions usage?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management has a data collector that collects access permissions that are assigned to various identities, activity logs, and resources metadata. The data collector provides full visibility into permissions granted to all identities to access the resources and details on usage of granted permissions.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How does Permissions Management evaluate cloud permissions risk?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management offers granular visibility into all identities and their permissions granted versus used, across cloud infrastructures to uncover any action performed by any identity on any resource. The visibility isn't limited to just user identities, but also workload identities such as virtual machines, access keys, containers, and scripts. The dashboard gives an overview of permission profile to locate the riskiest identities and resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What is the Permissions Creep Index?\\\\n+\\\\n+The Permissions Creep Index (PCI) is a quantitative measure of risk associated with an identity or role determined by comparing permissions granted versus permissions exercised. It allows users to instantly evaluate the level of risk associated with the number of unused or over-provisioned permissions across identities and resources. It measures how much damage identities can cause based on the permissions they have.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How can customers use Permissions Management to delete unused or excessive permissions?\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management allows users to right-size excessive permissions and automate least privilege policy enforcement with just a few clicks. The solution continuously analyzes historical permission usage data for each identity and gives customers the ability to right-size the permissions of that identity to permissions that are only being used for day-to-day operations. All unused and other risky permissions can be automatically removed.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Why is a user I deleted still visible in the Analytics tab?\\\\n+\\\\n+Check to see if the user was assigned a *Classic Administrator* role. Classic admin roles don't go away when a user is deleted. To resolve this, go to the [Classic admin page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268264) and delete that role assignment separately for the user.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How can customers grant permissions on-demand with Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+For any break-glass or one-off scenarios where an identity needs to perform a specific set of actions on a set of specific resources, the identity can request those permissions on-demand for a limited period with a self-service workflow. Customers can either use the built-in workflow engine or their IT service management (ITSM) tool. The user experience is the same for any identity type, identity source (local, enterprise directory, or federated) and cloud.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What is the difference between permissions on-demand and just-in-time access?\\\\n+\\\\n+Just-in-time (JIT) access is a method used to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure identities are given the minimum level of permissions to perform the task at hand. Permissions on-demand are a type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How can customers monitor permissions usage with Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+Customers only need to track the evolution of their Permission Creep Index (PCI) to monitor permissions usage. Customers can monitor PCI in the **Analytics** tab from their Permissions Management dashboard.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Can customers generate permissions usage reports?\\\\n+\\\\n+Yes, Permissions Management has various types of system report available that capture specific data sets. These reports allow customers to:\\\\n+- Make timely decisions.\\\\n+- Analyze usage trends and system/user performance.\\\\n+- Identify high-risk areas.\\\\n+\\\\n+For information about permissions usage reports, see [Generate and download the Permissions analytics report](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Does Permissions Management integrate with third-party ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) tools?\\\\n+\\\\n+Integration with ITSM tools, such as ServiceNow, is in the future roadmap.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How is Permissions Management being deployed?\\\\n+\\\\n+Customers assigned the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role must first onboard Permissions Management to their Microsoft Entra tenant, and then onboard their AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions. More details about onboarding can be found in our [product documentation](onboard-enable-tenant.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## How long does it take to deploy Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+It depends on each customer and how many AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions they have.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Once Permissions Management is deployed, how fast can I get permissions insights?\\\\n+\\\\n+Once fully onboarded with data collection setup, customers can access permissions usage insights within hours. Our machine-learning engine refreshes the Permission Creep Index every hour so that customers can start their risk assessment right away.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Is Permissions Management collecting and storing sensitive personal data?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, Permissions Management doesn't have access to sensitive personal data.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Where can I find more information about Permissions Management?\\\\n+\\\\n+You can read our [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity) and visit our [web page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management). You can also get in touch with your Microsoft point of contact to schedule a demo.\\\\n+\\\\n+## What is the data destruction/decommission process?\\\\n+\\\\n+If a customer initiates a free Permissions Management 45-day trial and does not convert to a paid license within 45 days of the trial expiration, all collected data is deleted within 30 days of the trial expiration date.  \\\\n+\\\\n+If a customer decides to discontinue licensing the service, all previously collected data is deleted within 30 days of license termination.\\\\n+\\\\n+Customers can also remove, export or modify specific data if a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) using the Permissions Management service files an official Data Subject Request. To file a request:\\\\n+\\\\n+If you're an enterprise customer, you can contact your Microsoft representative, account team, or tenant admin to file a high-priority IcM support ticket requesting a Data Subject Request. Do not include details or any personally identifiable information in the IcM request. We'll reach out to you for these details only after an IcM is filed.\\\\n+\\\\n+If you're a self-service customer (you set up a trial or paid license in the Microsoft 365 admin center) you can contact the Permissions Management privacy team by selecting your profile drop-down menu, then **Account Settings** in Permissions Management. Follow the instructions to make a Data Subject Request.\\\\n+\\\\n+Learn more about [Azure Data Subject Requests](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2245178).\\\\n+\\\\n+<a name='do-i-require-a-license-to-use-entra-permissions-management-'></a>\\\\n+\\\\n+## Do I require a license to use Microsoft Entra Permissions Management? \\\\n+\\\\n+Yes, as of July 1, 2022, new customers must acquire a free 45-day trial license or a paid license to use the service. You can enable a trial here: [https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement](https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement) or you can directly purchase resource-based licenses here: [https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement](https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement) \\\\n+\\\\n+## How is Permissions Management priced? \\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management is $125 per resources/year ($10.40 per resource/month). Permissions Management requires licenses for workloads, which include any resource that uses compute or memory. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Do I need to pay for all resources?\\\\n+\\\\n+Although Permissions Management supports all resources, Microsoft only requires licenses for billable resources per cloud environment. To learn more about billable resources, visit [View billable resources listed in your authorization system](product-data-billable-resources.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+## How do I calculate the number of billable resources I have? \\\\n+\\\\n+To calculate the billable resources you have across your multicloud infrastructure, you must first activate a [45-day free trial](https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement) of Permissions Management or [purchase a paid license](https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement).

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n+\\\\n+If you're an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer who uses the AWS IAM Identity Center, you can configure the Identity Center as an identity provider in Permissions Management. Configuring your AWS IAM Identity Center information allows you to receive more accurate data for your identities in Permissions Management.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Configuring AWS IAM Identity Center as an identity provider is an optional step. By configuring identity provider information, Permissions Management can read user and role access configured at AWS IAM Identity Center. Admins can see the augmented view of assigned permissions to the identities. You can return to these steps to configure an IdP at any time.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How to configure AWS IAM Identity Center as an identity provider\\\\n+\\\\n+1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches, select **Settings** (gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+2. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **AWS**, and then select **Create Configuration**. If a Data Collector already exists in your AWS account and you want to add AWS IAM integration, then: \\\\n+    - Select the Data Collector for which you want to configure AWS IAM. \\\\n+    - Click on the ellipsis next to the **Authorization Systems Status**. \\\\n+    - Select **Integrate Identity Provider**. \\\\n+\\\\n+3. On the **Integrate Identity provider (IdP)** page, select the box for **AWS IAM Identity Center**. \\\\n+\\\\n+4. Fill in the following fields:\\\\n+    - The **AWS IAM Identity Center Region**. Specify the region where AWS IAM Identity Center is installed. All data configured in the IAM Identity Center  \\\\n+    is stored in the Region where the IAM Identity Center is installed.   \\\\n+    - Your **AWS Management Account ID**\\\\n+    - Your **AWS Management Account Role**\\\\n+\\\\n+5. Select **Launch Management Account Template**. The template opens in a new window. \\\\n+6. If the Management Account stack is created with the CloudFormation Template as part of the previous onboarding steps, update the stack by running ``EnableSSO`` as true. Running this command creates a new stack when running the Management Account Template. \\\\n+\\\\n+The template execution attaches the AWS managed policy  ``AWSSSOReadOnly`` and the newly created custom policy ``SSOPolicy`` to the AWS IAM role that allows Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to collect organizational information. The following details are requested in the template. All fields are prepopulated, and you can edit the data as you need: \\\\n+- **Stack name** – The Stack name is the name of the AWS stack for creating the required AWS resources for Permissions Management to collect organizational information. The default value is ``mciem-org-<tenant-id>``. \\\\n+\\\\n+- **CFT Parameters**\\\\n+    - **OIDC Provider Role Name** – Name of the IAM Role OIDC Provider that can assume the role. The default value is the OIDC account role (as entered in Permissions Management).\\\\n+\\\\n+    - **Org Account Role Name** - Name of the IAM Role. The default value is prepopulated with the Management account role name (as entered in Microsoft Entra PM).\\\\n+\\\\n+    - **true** – Enables AWS SSO. The default value is ``true`` when the template is launched from the Configure Identity Provider (IdP) page, otherwise the default is ``false``. \\\\n+\\\\n+    - **OIDC Provider Account ID** – The Account ID where the OIDC Provider is created. The default value is the OIDC Provider Account ID (as entered in Permissions Management). \\\\n+\\\\n+    - **Tenant ID** – ID of the tenant where the application is created. The default value is ``tenant-id`` (the configured tenant). \\\\n+7. Click **Next** to review and confirm the information you've entered.\\\\n+\\\\n+8.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire). \\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is retiring on October 01, 2025, with new purchases unavailable starting April 1, 2025. Existing paid customers will continue to have access to Permissions Management between April 1, 2025 - September 30, 2025. \\\\n+\\\\n+On October 01, 2025, Permissions Management will be automatically offboarded and associated data collection will be deleted. For customers needing to offboard before October 1, 2025, refer to the [Offboarding steps](#offboarding-steps) section in this guide. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Why is Permissions Management being retired? \\\\n+\\\\n+The decision to phase out Microsoft Entra Permissions Management from the Microsoft Security portfolio was made after deep consideration of our innovation portfolio and how we can focus on delivering the best innovations aligned to our differentiating areas and partners with the ecosystem on adjacencies. We remain committed to delivering top-tier solutions across the Microsoft Entra portfolio, which includes Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Suite (encompassing ID Protection, ID Governance, Verified ID, Internet Access, and Private Access), Microsoft Entra External ID, Microsoft Entra Workload ID, and more.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Recommended solutions\\\\n+\\\\n+Since Permissions Management is retiring, Microsoft recommends that customers who have onboarded the product in their environment start planning for transition. Customers who are not onboarded should refrain from onboarding.   \\\\n+\\\\n+To support this transition, Microsoft is partnering with [Delinea](https://delinea.com/). Delinea offers a cloud-native, fully Microsoft-compatible Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) solution, Privilege Control for Cloud Entitlements (PCCE). PCCE provides functionality comparable to Permissions Management, including continuous discovery of entitlements that allow you to monitor and adjust access rights for both human and machine identities.  \\\\n+\\\\n+We recommend beginning the shift away from Permissions Management as soon as possible, well before September 30th. We're committed to providing extensive support, alongside our partner, Delinea.  \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Recommended steps before migrating to Delinea\\\\n+\\\\n+To ensure you continue with the CIEM objectives with our recommended partner, we recommend making a note of the following information from your Permissions Management portal: \\\\n+\\\\n+- First, go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview), then click **Permissions Management** from the navigation blade. \\\\n+\\\\n+    - Authorization system IDs which are being monitored across Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Settings (Gear icon)** and select the **Authorization Systems** tab to view list of Authorization system IDs.  \\\\n+    - Groups and users given admin access with the Permissions Management Administrator role in Entra ID. To find this, launch **Entra ID**, select **Roles and Admins**, search for **Permissions Management Administrator role**, select **Assignments**. \\\\n+    - Authorization system-specific access provided to groups through the Permissions Management portal. To find this, launch **Permissions Management** portal, Select **User Management**, then click the **Groups** tab to view all group assignments.  \\\\n+    - Custom reports configured in your environment. To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Reports**, navigate to **Custom Reports**.\\\\n+    - Alerts configured in your environment. To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Alerts** (bell icon), navigate to respective alerts tab.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Offboarding steps\\\\n+\\\\n+Once onboarded to our recommended partner and/or any other vendor, customers can initiate offboarding. Follow these steps in order:  \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Remove permissions assigned in AWS, Azure, and GCP.\\\\n+1. Remove the OIDC application for AWS and GCP environments.\\\\n+1. Stop collecting data for your entire list of accounts / subscriptions/ projects by deleting the associated data collectors: This ensures no new data is collected and you'll no longer have access to any historic data.\\\\n+1. Disable user sign-in to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) enterprise application   \\\\n+\\\\n+ Continue for detailed guidelines for each of these steps.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Remove permissions assigned in AWS, Azure, and GCP\\\\n+\\\\n+For successful offboarding of your data, remove permissions from your onboarded cloud provider (Azure, AWS, or GCP) and Permissions Management. Any roles and permissions assigned during onboarding should be removed. This ensures your environment is secure with no overprivileged access once your environment is offboarded from Permissions Management. \\\\n+\\\\n+Refer to the Data Collector configuration from the Permissions Management portal and select the settings (gear icon). Note down the configuration settings to remove roles and permissions assigned in your respective cloud provider.  \\\\n+\\\\n+## Remove the OIDC application for AWS and GCP environments\\\\n+\\\\n+For AWS and GCP, delete the application created in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center tenant where Permissions Management is enabled. This app was used to set up an OIDC (OpenID Connect) connection to your AWS and GCP environments.   \\\\n+\\\\n+To find the Enterprise Application created which was used to set up OIDC connection to your AWS and GCP environments, follow the below steps: \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE] \\\\n+> User must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) and [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator) role assignments to perform this task. \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n+1. Launch the **Permissions Management** portal.\\\\n+1. Select **Settings** (gear icon), then select the **Data Collectors** tab.\\\\n+1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select your authorization system type:\\\\n+    - **AWS** for Amazon Web Services. \\\\n+    - **GCP** for Google Cloud Platform.\\\\n+1. Select the ellipses **(...)** at the end of the row in the table.\\\\n+1. Select **Edit Configuration**. The app is located under the **Azure App** name.\\\\n+1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n+1. Navigate to **Entra ID** > **App registrations**. \\\\n+1. Enter the name of the existing application in the search box, and then select the application from the search results.\\\\n+1. From the Overview page, select **Delete**. Read the deletion consequences. Check the box if one appears at the bottom of the pane.\\\\n+1. Select **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete the app. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Stop data collection\\\\n+\\\\n+Stop collecting data for your list of accounts / subscriptions / projects by deleting the associated data collectors. \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> User must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to perform this task.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n+1. Select **Permissions Management** and click on **Launch portal**. \\\\n+1. Select **Settings** (the gear icon), then select the **Data Collectors** tab. \\\\n+1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select your authorization system type: \\\\n+    - **AWS** for Amazon Web Services. \\\\n+    - **Azure** for Microsoft Azure. \\\\n+    - **GCP** for Google Cloud Platform. \\\\n+1. Select the ellipses **(...)** at the end of the row in the table. \\\\n+1. Select **Delete Configuration**. The **Permissions Management Onboarding - Summary** box displays. \\\\n+1. Select **Delete**. \\\\n+1. Check your email for a one-time password (OTP) code, then enter it in **Enter OTP**. \\\\n+1. If you don't receive an OTP, select **Resend OTP**. \\\\n+1. The following message displays: ```Successfully deleted configuration```. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Disable user sign-in to the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) enterprise application\\\\n+\\\\n+Once data collection stops for all AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, and GCP projects, disable the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) app so that it can't be signed in. This ensures Permissions Management can no longer access your environments (accounts, subscriptions and projects).  \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> User must have the [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator) role assignment to perform this task. \\\\n+\\\\n+To disable the CIEM App for users to sign in: \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n+1. Navigate to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **All applications**.\\\\n+1. Search for **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management**. If you can’t locate the app, reset the filters.\\\\n+1. Open **Properties**.\\\\n+1.

These terms help Permissions Management users navigate through cloud-specific terms and cloud-generic terms.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Commonly used acronyms and terms\\\\n+\\\\n+| Term                  | Definition                                          |\\\\n+|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\\\\n+| ACL                  | Access control list. A list of files or resources that contain information about which users or groups have permission to access those resources or modify those files.    |\\\\n+| ARN                  | Azure Resource Notification    |\\\\n+| Authorization System                   | CIEM supports AWS accounts, Azure Subscriptions, GCP projects as the Authorization systems     |\\\\n+| Authorization System Type                  | Any system that provides the authorizations by assigning the permissions to the identities, resources. CIEM supports AWS, Azure, GCP as the Authorization System Types     |\\\\n+| Cloud security        | A form of cybersecurity that protects data stored online on cloud computing platforms from theft, leakage, and deletion. Includes firewalls, penetration testing, obfuscation, tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and avoiding public internet connections.     |\\\\n+| Cloud storage         | A service model in which data is maintained, managed, and backed up remotely. Available to users over a network.                |\\\\n+| CIAM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Access Management     |\\\\n+| CIEM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management. The next generation of solutions for enforcing least privilege in the cloud. It addresses cloud-native security challenges of managing identity access management in cloud environments.      |\\\\n+| CIS                  | Cloud infrastructure security      |\\\\n+| CWP                  | Cloud Workload Protection. A workload-centric security solution that targets the unique protection requirements of workloads in modern enterprise environments. |\\\\n+| CNAPP                | Cloud-Native Application Protection. The convergence of cloud security posture management (CSPM), cloud workload protection (CWP), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and cloud applications security broker (CASB). An integrated security approach that covers the entire lifecycle of cloud-native applications. |\\\\n+| CSPM                 | Cloud Security Posture Management. Addresses risks of compliance violations and misconfigurations in enterprise cloud environments. Also focuses on the resource level to identify deviations from best practice security settings for cloud governance and compliance.      |\\\\n+| CWPP                  | Cloud Workload Protection Platform    |\\\\n+| Data Collector | Virtual entity which stores the data collection configuration |\\\\n+| Delete task          | A high-risk task that allows users to permanently delete a resource.     |\\\\n+| ED | Enterprise directory |\\\\n+| Entitlement          | An abstract attribute that represents different forms of user permissions in a range of infrastructure systems and business applications.|\\\\n+| Entitlement management     | Technology that grants, resolves, enforces, revokes, and administers fine-grained access entitlements (that is, authorizations, privileges, access rights, permissions and rules). Its purpose is to execute IT access policies to structured/unstructured data, devices, and services. It can be delivered by different technologies, and is often different across platforms, applications, network components, and devices. |\\\\n+| High-risk permission | Permissions that have the potential to cause data leakage, service disruption and degradation, or changes in security posture. |\\\\n+| High-risk task       | A task in which a user can cause data leakage, service disruption, or service degradation.     |\\\\n+| Hybrid cloud          | Sometimes called a cloud hybrid. A computing environment that combines an on-premises data center (a private cloud) with a public cloud. It allows data and applications to be shared between them.                |\\\\n+| hybrid cloud storage    | A private or public cloud used to store an organization's data.    |\\\\n+| ICM                     | Incident Case Management                     |\\\\n+| IDS                    | Intrusion Detection Service                    |\\\\n+| Identity | An identity is a human identity (user) or workload identity. There are different names and types of workload identities for each cloud. AWS: Lambda function (serverless function), role, resource. Azure: Azure function (serverless function), service principal. GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |\\\\n+| Identity analytics    | Includes basic monitoring and remediation, dormant and orphan account detection and removal, and privileged account discovery. |\\\\n+| Identity lifecycle management | Maintain digital identities, their relationships with the organization, and their attributes during the entire process from creation to eventual archiving, using one or more identity life cycle patterns. |\\\\n+| IGA                   | Identity governance and administration. Technology solutions that conduct identity management and access governance operations. IGA includes the tools, technologies, reports, and compliance activities required for identity lifecycle management. It includes every operation from account creation and termination to user provisioning, access certification, and enterprise password management. It looks at automated workflow and data from authoritative sources capabilities, self-service user provisioning, IT governance, and password management. |\\\\n+| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |\\\\n+| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |\\\\n+| ITSM                     | Information Technology Security Management. Tools that enable IT operations organizations (infrastructure and operations managers), to better support the production environment. Facilitate the tasks and workflows associated with the management and delivery of quality IT services.      |\\\\n+| JEP | Just Enough Permissions |\\\\n+| JIT                    | Just in Time access can be seen as a way to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure users and non-human identities are given the minimum level of privileges. It also ensures that privileged activities are conducted in accordance with an organization's Identity Access Management (IAM), IT Service Management (ITSM), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) policies, with its entitlements and workflows. JIT access strategy enables organizations to maintain a full audit trail of privileged activities so they can easily identify who or what gained access to which systems, what they did at what time, and for how long.     |\\\\n+| Least privilege        | Ensures that users only gain access to the specific tools they need to complete a task.  |\\\\n+| Multi-tenant            | A single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database.                    |\\\\n+| OIDC                    | OpenID Connect. An authentication protocol that verifies user identity when a user is trying to access a protected HTTPS end point. OIDC is an evolutionary development of ideas implemented earlier in OAuth. |\\\\n+| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. | \\\\n+| PAM                   | Privileged access management. Tools that offer one or more of these features: discover, manage, and govern privileged accounts on multiple systems and applications; control access to privileged accounts, including shared and emergency access; randomize, manage, and vault credentials (password, keys, etc.) for administrative, service, and application accounts; single sign-on (SSO) for privileged access to prevent credentials from being revealed; control, filter, and orchestrate privileged commands, actions, and tasks; manage and broker credentials to applications, services, and devices to avoid exposure; and monitor, record, audit, and analyze privileged access, sessions, and actions. |\\\\n+| PASM                  | Privileged accounts are protected by vaulting their credentials. Access to those accounts is then brokered for human users, services, and applications. Privileged session management (PSM) functions establish sessions with possible credential injection and full session recording. Passwords and other credentials for privileged accounts are actively managed and changed at definable intervals or upon the occurrence of specific events. PASM solutions may also provide application-to-application password management (AAPM) and zero-install remote privileged access features for IT staff and third parties that don't require a VPN.  |\\\\n+| PEDM                  | Specific privileges are granted on the managed system by host-based agents to logged-in users. PEDM tools provide host-based command control (filtering); application allow, deny, and isolate controls; and/or privilege elevation. The latter is in the form of allowing particular commands to be run with a higher level of privileges. PEDM tools execute on the actual operating system at the kernel or process level. Command control through protocol filtering is explicitly excluded from this definition because the point of control is less reliable. PEDM tools may also provide file integrity monitoring features. |\\\\n+| Permission            | Rights and privileges. An action an identity can perform on a resource. Details given by users or network administrators that define access rights to files on a network. Access controls attached to a resource dictating which identities can access it and how. Permissions are attached to identities and are the ability to perform certain actions. |\\\\n+| POD                    | Permission on Demand. A type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.      |\\\\n+| Permissions creep index (PCI)    | A number from 0 to 100 that represents the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. PCI is a function of users who have access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them.    |\\\\n+| Policy and role management | Maintain rules that govern automatic assignment and removal of access rights. Provides visibility of access rights for selection in access requests, approval processes, dependencies, and incompatibilities between access rights, and more. Roles are a common vehicle for policy management. |\\\\n+| Privilege             | The authority to make changes to a network or computer. Both people and accounts can have privileges, and both can have different levels of privilege.        |\\\\n+| Privileged account    | A login credential to a server, firewall, or other administrative account. Often referred to as admin accounts. Comprised of the actual username and password; these two things together make up the account. A privileged account is allowed to do more things than a normal account. |\\\\n+| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |\\\\n+| Public Cloud            | Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.                |\\\\n+| Resource              | Any entity that uses compute capabilities can be accessed by users and services to perform actions. |\\\\n+| Role                    | An IAM identity that has specific permissions. Instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. A role doesn't have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with.                  |\\\\n+| SCIM                    | System for Cross–domain Identity Management |\\\\n+| SIEM                    | Security Information and Event Management. Technology that supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through the collection and analysis (both near real time and historical) of security events, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources. The core capabilities are a broad scope of log event collection and management, the ability to analyze log events and other data across disparate sources, and operational capabilities (such as incident management, dashboards, and reporting).      |\\\\n+| SOAR                  | Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR). Technologies that enable organizations to take inputs from various sources (mostly from security information and event management [SIEM] systems) and apply workflows aligned to processes and procedures. These workflows can be orchestrated via integrations with other technologies and automated to achieve the desired outcome and greater visibility. Other capabilities include case and incident management features; the ability to manage threat intelligence, dashboards and reporting; and analytics that can be applied across various functions. SOAR tools significantly enhance security operations activities like threat detection and response by providing machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes.    |\\\\n+| Super user / Super identity     | A powerful account used by IT system administrators that can be used to make configurations to a system or application, add or remove users, or delete data. Super users and identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account).   |\\\\n+| Tenant                | A dedicated instance of the services and organization data stored within a specific default location.                  |\\\\n+| UUID                    | Universally unique identifier.

A product or service that creates an identity- and context-based, logical access boundary around an application or set of applications. The applications are hidden from discovery, and access is restricted via a trust broker to a set of named entities. The broker verifies the identity, context and policy adherence of the specified participants before allowing access and prohibits lateral movement elsewhere in the network. It removes application assets from public visibility and significantly reduces the surface area for attack.|\\\\n+\\\\n+## Next steps\\\\n+\\\\n+- For an overview of Permissions Management, see [What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?](overview.md).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"f6df0a23228313a72c46a7cea97b30864e344b35\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/onboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 109,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 109,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/fb74d47ded7bba616bb6ab5256a7eb80eaf74273/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/fb74d47ded7bba616bb6ab5256a7eb80eaf74273/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md?ref=fb74d47ded7bba616bb6ab5256a7eb80eaf74273\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,109 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Add an account/subscription/project to Permissions Management after onboarding is complete\\\\n+description: How to add an account/subscription/project to Permissions Management after onboarding is complete.\\\\n+author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n+manager: pmwongera\\\\n+ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n+\\\\n+ms.topic: how-to\\\\n+ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n+ms.author: jfields\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Add an account/ subscription/ project after onboarding is complete\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

Return to Permissions Management, and in the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Central Logging Account Details** page, select **Next**.\\\\n+\\\\n+### 5. Set up an AWS member account\\\\n+\\\\n+Select **Enable AWS SSO checkbox**, if the AWS account access is configured through AWS SSO. \\\\n+\\\\n+Choose from three options to manage AWS accounts. \\\\n+\\\\n+#### Option 1: Automatically manage \\\\n+\\\\n+Choose this option to automatically detect and add to the monitored account list, without extra configuration. Steps to detect list of accounts and onboard for collection: \\\\n+\\\\n+- Deploy Management account CFT (Cloudformation template) which creates organization account role that grants permission to OIDC role created earlier to list accounts, OUs and SCPs. \\\\n+- If AWS SSO is enabled, organization account CFT also adds policy needed to collect AWS SSO configuration details. \\\\n+- Deploy Member account CFT in all the accounts that need to be monitored by Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. These actions create a cross account role that trusts the OIDC role created earlier. The SecurityAudit policy is attached to the role created for data collection. \\\\n+\\\\n+Any current or future accounts found get onboarded automatically. \\\\n+\\\\n+To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n+\\\\n+- Go to **Data Collectors** tab.  \\\\n+- Click on the status of the data collector.  \\\\n+- View accounts on the **In Progress** page \\\\n+\\\\n+#### Option 2: Enter authorization systems\\\\n+1.

Click the plus icon next to the text box to add more account IDs.\\\\n+\\\\n+    > [!NOTE]\\\\n+    > Do the following steps for each account ID you add:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Open another browser window and sign in to the AWS console for the member account.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Return to the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Member Account Details** page, select **Launch Template**.\\\\n+\\\\n+    The **AWS CloudFormation create stack** page opens, displaying the template.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the **CloudTrailBucketName** page, enter a name.\\\\n+\\\\n+    You can copy and paste the **CloudTrailBucketName** name from the **Trails** page in AWS.\\\\n+\\\\n+    > [!NOTE]\\\\n+    >  A *cloud bucket* collects all the activity in a single account that Permissions Management monitors. Enter the name of a cloud bucket here to provide Permissions Management with the access required to collect activity data.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. From the **Enable Controller** dropdown, select:\\\\n+\\\\n+    - **True**, if you want the controller to provide Permissions Management with read and write access so that any remediation you want to do from the Permissions Management platform can be done automatically.\\\\n+    - **False**, if you want the controller to provide Permissions Management with read-only access.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and in the **Capabilities** box, select **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names**. Then select **Create stack**.\\\\n+\\\\n+    This AWS CloudFormation stack creates a collection role in the member account with necessary permissions (policies) for data collection.\\\\n+\\\\n+    A trust policy is set on this role to allow the OIDC role created in your AWS OIDC account to access it. These entities are listed in the **Resources** tab of your CloudFormation stack.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Return to Permissions Management, and in the **Permissions Management Onboarding - AWS Member Account Details** page, select **Next**.\\\\n+\\\\n+    This step completes the sequence of required connections from Microsoft Entra STS to the OIDC connection account and the AWS member account.\\\\n+    \\\\n+#### Option 3: Select authorization systems \\\\n+\\\\n+This option detects all AWS accounts that are accessible through OIDC role access created earlier.  \\\\n+\\\\n+- Deploy Management account CFT (Cloudformation template) which creates organization account role that grants permission to OIDC role created earlier to list accounts, OUs and SCPs. \\\\n+- If AWS SSO is enabled, organization account CFT also adds policy needed to collect AWS SSO configuration details. \\\\n+- Deploy Member account CFT in all the accounts that need to be monitored by Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. These actions create a cross account role that trusts the OIDC role created earlier. The SecurityAudit policy is attached to the role created for data collection. \\\\n+- Click Verify and Save. \\\\n+- Go to the newly create Data Collector row under AWSdata collectors. \\\\n+- Click on Status column when the row has **Pending** status \\\\n+- To onboard and start collection, choose specific ones from the detected list and consent for collection. \\\\n+\\\\n+### 6. Review and save\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Below is what is required to configure onboarding:\\\\n+\\\\n+* When your tenant is onboarded, an application is created in the tenant.\\\\n+* This app requires 'reader' permissions on the subscriptions\\\\n+* For controller functionality, the app requires 'User Access Administrator' to create and implement right-size roles\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+To add Permissions Management to your Microsoft Entra tenant:\\\\n+- You must have a Microsoft Entra user account and an Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) on your system, or an Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).\\\\n+- You must have **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission at the subscription or management group scope to perform these tasks. If you don't have this permission, you can ask someone who has this permission to perform these tasks for you.\\\\n+\\\\n+## How to onboard an Azure subscription\\\\n+\\\\n+1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches:\\\\n+\\\\n+    - In the Permissions Management home page, select **Settings** (the gear icon, top right), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Add Azure subscription details\\\\n+\\\\n+Choose from three options to manage Azure subscriptions. \\\\n+\\\\n+#### Option 1: Automatically manage \\\\n+\\\\n+This option lets subscriptions be automatically detected and monitored without further work required. A key benefit of automatic management is that any current or future subscriptions found are onboarded automatically. The steps to detect a list of subscriptions and onboard for collection are as follows:  \\\\n+\\\\n+- Firstly, grant Reader role to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application at management group or subscription scope. To do this:  \\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the EPM portal, left-click the cog on the top right-hand side.  \\\\n+1. Go to data collectors tab \\\\n+1. Ensure **Azure** is selected.\\\\n+1. Click **Create Configuration.**\\\\n+1. For onboarding mode, select **Automatically Manage.**\\\\n+\\\\n+    > [!NOTE]\\\\n+    > The steps listed on the screen outline how to create the role assignment for the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management application. This is performed manually in the Microsoft Entra ID console, or programmatically with PowerShell or the Azure CLI.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Once complete, Click **Verify Now & Save.**\\\\n+\\\\n+To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Collectors are now listed and change through status types. For each collector listed with a status of **Collected Inventory,** click on that status to view further information. \\\\n+1. You can then view subscriptions on the In Progress page.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Option 2: Enter authorization systems \\\\n+\\\\n+You have the ability to specify only certain subscriptions to manage and monitor with Permissions Management (up to 100 per collector). Follow the steps below to configure these subscriptions to be monitored: \\\\n+\\\\n+1. For each subscription you wish to manage, ensure that the ‘Reader’ role has been granted to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application for the subscription. \\\\n+1. In the EPM portal, click the cog on the top right-hand side. \\\\n+1. Go to data collectors tab \\\\n+1. Ensure 'Azure' is selected\\\\n+1. Click ‘Create Configuration’ \\\\n+1. Select ‘Enter Authorization Systems’ \\\\n+1. Under the Subscription IDs section, enter a desired subscription ID into the input box. Click the “+” up to nine extra times, putting a single subscription ID into each respective input box. \\\\n+1. Once you have input all of the desired subscriptions, click next \\\\n+1. Click ‘Verify Now & Save’ \\\\n+1. Once the access to read and collect data is verified, collection will begin. \\\\n+\\\\n+To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Go to the **Data Collectors** tab.  \\\\n+1. Click on the status of the data collector.  \\\\n+1. View subscriptions on the In Progress page.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Option 3: Select authorization systems \\\\n+\\\\n+This option detects all subscriptions that are accessible by the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application.  \\\\n+\\\\n+- Firstly, grant Reader role to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application at management group or subscription scope.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the Permissions Management portal, click the cog on the top right-hand side.  \\\\n+1. Go to the **Data Collectors** tab.\\\\n+1. Ensure **Azure** is selected.\\\\n+1. Click **Create Configuration.** \\\\n+1. For onboarding mode, select **Automatically Manage.** \\\\n+\\\\n+    > [!NOTE]\\\\n+    > The steps listed on the screen outline how to create the role assignment for the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management application. You can do this manually in the Microsoft Entra ID console, or programmatically with PowerShell or the Azure CLI.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Once complete, Click **Verify Now & Save.** \\\\n+\\\\n+To view status of onboarding after saving the configuration: \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Go to newly create Data Collector row under Azure data collectors. \\\\n+1. Click on Status column when the row has **Pending** status \\\\n+1. To onboard and start collection, choose specific ones subscriptions from the detected list and consent for collection.\\\\n+\\\\n+### 2. Review and save.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In **Permissions Management Onboarding – Summary** page, review the information you've added, and then select **Verify Now & Save**.\\\\n+\\\\n+    The following message appears: **Successfully Created Configuration.**\\\\n+\\\\n+    On the **Data Collectors** tab, the **Recently Uploaded On** column displays **Collecting**. The **Recently Transformed On** column displays **Processing.**\\\\n+\\\\n+    The status column in your Permissions Management UI shows you which step of data collection you're at:  \\\\n+ \\\\n+    - **Pending**: Permissions Management has not started detecting or onboarding yet. \\\\n+    - **Discovering**: Permissions Management is detecting the authorization systems. \\\\n+    - **In progress**: Permissions Management has finished detecting the authorization systems and is onboarding. \\\\n+    - **Onboarded**: Data collection is complete, and all detected authorization systems are onboarded to Permissions Management. \\\\n+\\\\n+### 3.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n+\\\\n+Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) is a security model that helps organizations manage and control user access and entitlements in their cloud infrastructure. CIEM is a critical component of a Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) solution providing visibility into who has access to what resources and ensuring access rights align with the principle of least privilege (PoLP), where users have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks.  \\\\n+ \\\\n+Microsoft delivers both CNAPP and CIEM solutions with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CNAPP) and Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (CIEM). While both Defender for Cloud and Permissions Management help secure customers’ cloud environments, they're two distinct security solutions that address different aspects of cloud security. Permissions Management focuses on managing and enforcing fine-grained access controls, permissions, and entitlements for identities across multicloud infrastructures. Defender for Cloud focuses on securing cloud-native applications such as containers, microservices, and serverless applications through visibility into application behavior and security posture.  \\\\n+\\\\n+## How Permissions Management works with Defender for Cloud\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management capabilities are available to integrate into the Defender for Cloud CSPM plan. Adding the capabilities of Permissions Management to Defender for Cloud strengthens the prevention of security breaches that might occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. These added features make Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Permissions Management and Defender for Cloud capabilities\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud/permissions-management-defender-for-cloud-comparison.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A table showing the difference in capabilities of Permissions Management and Defender for Cloud.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud/permissions-management-defender-for-cloud-comparison.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Common use cases and scenarios\\\\n+\\\\n+With the added capabilities of Permissions Management, you can track permissions analytics, unused permissions for active identities, and over-permissioned identities then act to mitigate them to support the best practice of least privilege in Defender for Cloud. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Next steps\\\\n+\\\\n+- For instructions on how to enable Permissions Management in your Defender for Cloud environment, see [Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252561).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"38229458421e825dc0891ac42eaac806f50ecb25\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/permissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 196,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 196,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/fb74d47ded7bba616bb6ab5256a7eb80eaf74273/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/fb74d47ded7bba616bb6ab5256a7eb80eaf74273/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md?ref=fb74d47ded7bba616bb6ab5256a7eb80eaf74273\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,196 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Microsoft Entra Permissions Management Quickstart Guide\\\\n+description: Quickstart guide - How to quickly onboard your Microsoft Entra Permissions Management product\\\\n+author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n+manager: pmwongera\\\\n+ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n+ms.topic: quickstart\\\\n+ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n+ms.author: jfields\\\\n+ms.custom: sfi-image-nochange\\\\n+# CustomerIntent: As a security administrator, I want to successfully onboard Permissions Management so that I can enable identity security in my cloud environment as efficiently as possible.'\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Quickstart guide to Microsoft Entra Permissions Management \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

These identities include over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management helps your organization effectively secure and manage cloud permissions by detecting, automatically right-sizing, and continuously monitoring unused and excessive permissions. \\\\n+\\\\n+With this quickstart guide, you’ll set up your multicloud environment(s), configure data collection, and enable permissions access to ensure your cloud identities are managed and secure.  \\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites \\\\n+\\\\n+Before you begin, you need access to these tools for the onboarding process: \\\\n+\\\\n+- Access to a local BASH shell with the Azure CLI or Azure Cloud Shell using BASH environment (Azure CLI is included). \\\\n+- Access to AWS, Azure, and GCP consoles.\\\\n+- A user must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to create a new app registration in Microsoft Entra tenant is required for AWS and GCP onboarding. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Step 1: Set-up Permissions Management\\\\n+\\\\n+To enable Permissions Management, you must have a Microsoft Entra tenant (example, Microsoft Entra admin center).  \\\\n+- If you have an Azure account, you automatically have a Microsoft Entra admin center tenant. \\\\n+- If you don’t already have one, create a free account at [entra.microsoft.com.](https://entra.microsoft.com)\\\\n+\\\\n+If the above points are met, continue with:\\\\n+\\\\n+[Enable Microsoft Entra Permissions Management in your organization](onboard-enable-tenant.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+Ensure you're a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator).

Purchased licenses or activated your 45-day free trial for Permissions Management. \\\\n+3. Successfully launched Permissions Management.\\\\n+\\\\n+Now, you're going to learn about the role and settings of the Controller and Data collection modes in Permissions Management.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Set the controller \\\\n+The controller gives you the choice to determine the level of access you grant to users in Permissions Management.  \\\\n+\\\\n+- Enabling the controller during onboarding grants Permissions Management admin access, or read and write access, so users can right-size permissions and remediate directly through Permissions Management (instead of going to the AWS, Azure, or GCP consoles).  \\\\n+\\\\n+- Disabling the controller during onboarding, or never enabling it, grants a Permissions Management user read-only access to your environment(s).  \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> If you don't enable the controller during onboarding, you have the option to enable it after onboarding is complete. To set the controller in Permissions Management after onboarding, see [Enable or disable the controller after onboarding](onboard-enable-controller-after-onboarding.md).\\\\n+> For AWS environments, once you have enabled the controller, you *cannot* disable it. \\\\n+\\\\n+To set the controller settings during onboarding:\\\\n+1. Select **Enable** to give read and write access to Permissions Management.\\\\n+2. Select **Disable** to give read-only access to Permissions Management.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Configure data collection\\\\n+\\\\n+There are three modes to choose from in order to collect data in Permissions Management. \\\\n+\\\\n+- **Automatic (recommended)** \\\\n+Permissions Management automatically discovers, onboards, and monitors all current and future subscriptions. \\\\n+\\\\n+- **Manual** \\\\n+Manually enter individual subscriptions for Permissions Management to discover, onboard, and monitor. You can enter up to 100 subscriptions per data collection.  \\\\n+\\\\n+- **Select** \\\\n+Permissions Management automatically discovers all current subscriptions. Once discovered, you select which subscriptions to onboard and monitor. \\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE] \\\\n+> To use **Automatic** or **Select** modes, the controller must be enabled while configuring data collection. \\\\n+\\\\n+To configure data collection:\\\\n+1. In Permissions Management, go to the **Data Collectors** page.\\\\n+2. Select a cloud environment: **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**.\\\\n+3. Click **Create configuration**.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> The data collection process takes some time and occurs in approximately 4-5 hour intervals in most cases. The time frame depends on the size of the authorization system you have and how much data is available for collection.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Onboard Amazon Web Services (AWS)\\\\n+Since Permissions Management is hosted on Microsoft Entra, there are more steps to take to onboard your AWS environment.  \\\\n+\\\\n+To connect AWS to Permissions Management, you must create a Microsoft Entra application in the Microsoft Entra admin center tenant where Permissions Management is enabled.

There are different names and types of workload identities for each cloud. AWS: Lambda function (serverless function), role, resource. Azure: Azure function (serverless function), service principal. GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |\\\\n+| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |\\\\n+| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |\\\\n+| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. |  \\\\n+| Permission | A permission is an action an identity can perform on a resource. |\\\\n+| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |\\\\n+| Super identity | Super identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account). |\\\\n+| Used permissions | The number of permissions used by an identity in the last 90 days. |\\\\n+\\\\n+<!---## Add and remove tags in the Permissions analytics report\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n+\\\\n+Statistical anomalies can detect outliers in an identity's behavior if the recent activity is determined to be unusual based on models defined in an activity trigger. The goal of this alert trigger is a high recall rate.\\\\n+\\\\n+You can configure statistical anomaly alert triggers for the following scenarios:\\\\n+- **Identity Performed High Number of Tasks**: The identity performs higher than their usual volume of tasks. For example, an identity typically performs 25 tasks per day, and now it is performing 100 tasks per day.\\\\n+- **Identity Performed Low Number of Tasks**: The identity performs lower than their usual volume of tasks. For example, an identity typically performs 100 tasks per day, and now it is performing 25 tasks per day.\\\\n+- **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Results**: The identity performing an action gets a different result than usual, such as most tasks end in a successful result and are now ending in a failed result or vice versa.\\\\n+- **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Timing**: The identity does tasks at unusual times as established by their baseline in the observance period. Times are grouped by the following UTC 4-hour windows.\\\\n+- **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Types**: The identity performs unusual types of tasks as established by their baseline in the observance period. For example, an identity performs read, write, or delete tasks they wouldn't ordinarily perform.\\\\n+- **Identity Performed Tasks with Multiple Unusual Patterns**: The identity has several unusual patterns in the tasks performed by the identity as established by their baseline in the observance period.\\\\n+\\\\n+Alert triggers are based on data collected. All alerts, if triggered, are shown every hour under the Alerts subtab.\\\\n+\\\\n+## View statistical anomalies in an identity's behavior\\\\n+You can view statistical anomalies in an identity's behavior to monitor unusual activities in Permissions Management. This section explains how to access and interpret the alerts.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the Permissions Management home page, select **Alerts** (the bell icon).\\\\n+1. Select **Statistical Anomaly**, and then select the **Alerts** subtab.\\\\n+\\\\n+    The **Alerts** subtab displays the following information:\\\\n+\\\\n+      - **Alert Name**: Lists the name of the alert.\\\\n+      - **Anomaly Alert Rule**: Displays the name of the rule select when creating the alert.\\\\n+      - **# of Occurrences**: Displays how many times the alert trigger has occurred.\\\\n+      - **Authorization System**: Displays which authorization systems the alert applies to.\\\\n+      - **Date/Time**: Lists the day of the outlier occurring.\\\\n+      - **Date/Time (UTC)**: Lists the day of the outlier occurring in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+1. To filter the alerts based on name, select the appropriate alert name or choose **All** from the **Alert Name** dropdown menu, and select **Apply**.\\\\n+1. To filter the alerts based on alert time, select **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 2 Days**, **Last Week**, or **Custom Range** from the **Date** dropdown menu, and select **Apply**.\\\\n+1.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n+\\\\n+This article provides the latest Public Preview and General Availability information of features in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. \\\\n+\\\\n+## May 2024\\\\n+\\\\n+### General availability - Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration for Microsoft Defender for Cloud\\\\n+**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                      \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n+\\\\n+Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become the norm. Ensuring the security of cloud applications and infrastructure requires integrating identity and permission insights into the overall security strategy. This objective is achieved through the integration of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. \\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management capabilities are available to integrate into the Defender for Cloud CSPM plan. Adding the capabilities of [Permissions Management to Defender for Cloud](permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud.md) strengthens the prevention of security breaches that might occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. These added features make Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud. \\\\n+\\\\n+For instructions on how to enable Permissions Management in your Defender for Cloud environment, see [Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252561)\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### General availability - Support for PIM-enabled Groups \\\\n+**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                      \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n+\\\\n+Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups in Microsoft Entra ID allows Permissions Management admins to grant users just-in-time membership and ownership of a security group or a Microsoft 365 group. Nested groups are also supported. For example, if a user is an active member of Group A, and Group A is an eligible member of Group B, the user can activate their membership in Group B. PIM provides a powerful mechanism to manage access and enhance security by granting just-in-time access to critical resources. \\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership along with existing support for direct group membership. It also solves the challenge of having visibility into who has access to what resource with eligible and direct role assignments. This feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways and the potential impact on Permissions Creep Index (PCI). A complete list of RBAC role assignments is provisioned directly, via the group membership or by an eligible group member, and can be seen per identity under the Analytics tab. \\\\n+\\\\n+## March 2024\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Support for PIM-enabled Groups \\\\n+**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                      \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n+\\\\n+As multiple customers embrace PIM for groups as a popular feature, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership impact on the eligible granted Azure RBAC permissions and Permissions Creep Index (PCI). The feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways.  \\\\n+ \\\\n+In the Permissions Management console, admins can see the membership eligibility status as well as role eligibility status for Groups. For each identity, admins can get the visibility into the membership eligibility status as well as roles eligibility status. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## December 2023\\\\n+\\\\n+### General availability - Permissions Analytics Report PDF\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                      \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n+\\\\n+The [Permissions Analytics Report (PAR)](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). \\\\n+\\\\n+The PAR PDF is one part of the overall reporting redesign effort led by the engineering team. As part of this feature release, customers can download all reports (system or custom) with no row limitations in CSV and XSLX formats. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## October 2023\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public preview - Permissions Analytics Report PDF for multiple authorization systems\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                        \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management            \\\\n+\\\\n+The Permissions Analytics Report (PAR) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  \\\\n+\\\\n+The PAR PDF has a new design to enhance usability, align with the product UX redesign effort, and address various customer feature requests. [You can download the PAR PDF for up to 10 authorization systems](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+### General availability - ServiceNow app for Permissions Management\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                        \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management\\\\n+\\\\n+The ServiceNow Application for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management enables users to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) through the ServiceNow portal. This integration aids organizations in enhancing their Zero Trust posture by enforcing the principle of least privilege for multicloud permissions. The ServiceNow app streamlines access permission requests within existing approval workflows.  \\\\n+\\\\n+Get the ServiceNow app in the [ServiceNow app store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/24073ae31bfca9100e564082b24bcb56/1.0.1?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%25253Bgenerative_ai%25253Bsnow_solution%26q%3Dentra%2520permissions%2520management&sl=sh). \\\\n+\\\\n+### Public preview - Okta and AWS Identity Center identity provider integrations\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature   \\\\n+**Service category:**                        \\\\n+**Product capability:** Permissions Management\\\\n+\\\\n+Permissions Management supports third party identity providers (IdP) integration to get more insight of single sign-on data of permissions assigned in cloud environments. With this information, Permissions Management can provide more accurate analytics. By reading role assignments and user data from the IdP side, Permissions Management more effectively calculates permissions granted, and as a result, reads more precise data on permissions creep. \\\\n+\\\\n+For [Okta Identity Provider integration](how-to-configure-okta-as-an-identity-provider.md), an admin needs to configure the API application to give the access to read Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. Permissions Management reads Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. \\\\n+\\\\n+For [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center integration](how-to-configure-aws-iam.md), an admin can provide Permissions Management access to read user and role access configuration data from the management account by running the CloudFormation template (CFT) in their AWS environment. After successful configuration, Permissions Management can read the data to calculate the analytics.\\\\n+\\\"\\r\\n  }\\r\\n].

policies to trust MFA claims from external organizations. During authentication, Microsoft Entra ID checks a user's credentials for a claim that the user completed MFA. If not, an MFA challenge is initiated in the user's home tenant. This setting isn't applied if an external user signs in using [granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/customers/gdap-introduction), such as used by a technician at a Cloud Service Provider that administers services in your tenant.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Microsoft Entra Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities. For example, over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions. It deepens the Zero Trust security strategy by augmenting the least privilege access principle.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What are the prerequisites to use Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management supports data collection from AWS, GCP, and/or Microsoft Azure. For data collection and analysis, customers are required to have a Microsoft Entra account to use Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='can-a-customer-use-permissions-management-if-they-have-other-identities-with-access-to-their-iaas-platform-that-arent-yet-in-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can a customer use Permissions Management if they have other identities with access to their IaaS platform that aren't yet in Microsoft Entra ID?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, a customer can detect, mitigate, and monitor the risk for AWS IAM or GCP accounts, or from other identity providers such as Okta or AWS IAM.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Where can customers access Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers can access the Permissions Management interface from the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) .\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can noncloud customers use Permissions Management on-premises?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management is a hosted cloud offering.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can non-Azure customers use Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, non-Azure customers can use our solution. Permissions Management is a multicloud solution so even customers who have no subscription to Azure can benefit from it.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU)?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, Permissions Management is currently for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='if-im-already-using-azure-ad--privileged-identity-management-pim-for-azure-what-value-does-permissions-management-provide'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## If I'm already using Microsoft Entra ID  Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure, what value does Permissions Management provide?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management complements Microsoft Entra PIM. Microsoft Entra PIM provides just-in-time access for admin roles in Azure and Microsoft Online Services and apps that use groups. Permissions Management allows multicloud discovery, remediation, and monitoring of privileged access across Azure, AWS, and GCP.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What public cloud infrastructures does Permissions Management support?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management currently supports the three major public clouds: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Does Permissions Management support hybrid environments?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management currently doesn't support hybrid environments.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What types of identities does Permissions Management support?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management supports user identities (for example, employees, customers, external partners) and workload identities (for example, virtual machines, containers, web apps, serverless functions).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management available in Government Cloud?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management is currently not available in Government clouds.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management available for sovereign clouds?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management is currently not available in sovereign Clouds.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How does Permissions Management collect insights about permissions usage?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management has a data collector that collects access permissions that are assigned to various identities, activity logs, and resources metadata. The data collector provides full visibility into permissions granted to all identities to access the resources and details on usage of granted permissions.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How does Permissions Management evaluate cloud permissions risk?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management offers granular visibility into all identities and their permissions granted versus used, across cloud infrastructures to uncover any action performed by any identity on any resource. The visibility isn't limited to just user identities, but also workload identities such as virtual machines, access keys, containers, and scripts. The dashboard gives an overview of permission profile to locate the riskiest identities and resources.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What is the Permissions Creep Index?\\\\n-\\\\n-The Permissions Creep Index (PCI) is a quantitative measure of risk associated with an identity or role determined by comparing permissions granted versus permissions exercised. It allows users to instantly evaluate the level of risk associated with the number of unused or over-provisioned permissions across identities and resources. It measures how much damage identities can cause based on the permissions they have.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How can customers use Permissions Management to delete unused or excessive permissions?\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management allows users to right-size excessive permissions and automate least privilege policy enforcement with just a few clicks. The solution continuously analyzes historical permission usage data for each identity and gives customers the ability to right-size the permissions of that identity to permissions that are only being used for day-to-day operations. All unused and other risky permissions can be automatically removed.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Why is a user I deleted still visible in the Analytics tab?\\\\n-\\\\n-Check to see if the user was assigned a *Classic Administrator* role. Classic admin roles don't go away when a user is deleted. To resolve this, go to the [Classic admin page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268264) and delete that role assignment separately for the user.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How can customers grant permissions on-demand with Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-For any break-glass or one-off scenarios where an identity needs to perform a specific set of actions on a set of specific resources, the identity can request those permissions on-demand for a limited period with a self-service workflow. Customers can either use the built-in workflow engine or their IT service management (ITSM) tool. The user experience is the same for any identity type, identity source (local, enterprise directory, or federated) and cloud.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What is the difference between permissions on-demand and just-in-time access?\\\\n-\\\\n-Just-in-time (JIT) access is a method used to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure identities are given the minimum level of permissions to perform the task at hand. Permissions on-demand are a type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How can customers monitor permissions usage with Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers only need to track the evolution of their Permission Creep Index (PCI) to monitor permissions usage. Customers can monitor PCI in the **Analytics** tab from their Permissions Management dashboard.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can customers generate permissions usage reports?\\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, Permissions Management has various types of system report available that capture specific data sets. These reports allow customers to:\\\\n-- Make timely decisions.\\\\n-- Analyze usage trends and system/user performance.\\\\n-- Identify high-risk areas.\\\\n-\\\\n-For information about permissions usage reports, see [Generate and download the Permissions analytics report](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Does Permissions Management integrate with third-party ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) tools?\\\\n-\\\\n-Integration with ITSM tools, such as ServiceNow, is in the future roadmap.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How is Permissions Management being deployed?\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers assigned the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role must first onboard Permissions Management to their Microsoft Entra tenant, and then onboard their AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions. More details about onboarding can be found in our [product documentation](onboard-enable-tenant.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## How long does it take to deploy Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-It depends on each customer and how many AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions they have.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Once Permissions Management is deployed, how fast can I get permissions insights?\\\\n-\\\\n-Once fully onboarded with data collection setup, customers can access permissions usage insights within hours. Our machine-learning engine refreshes the Permission Creep Index every hour so that customers can start their risk assessment right away.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Is Permissions Management collecting and storing sensitive personal data?\\\\n-\\\\n-No, Permissions Management doesn't have access to sensitive personal data.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Where can I find more information about Permissions Management?\\\\n-\\\\n-You can read our [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity) and visit our [web page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management). You can also get in touch with your Microsoft point of contact to schedule a demo.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What is the data destruction/decommission process?\\\\n-\\\\n-If a customer initiates a free Permissions Management 45-day trial and does not convert to a paid license within 45 days of the trial expiration, all collected data is deleted within 30 days of the trial expiration date.  \\\\n-\\\\n-If a customer decides to discontinue licensing the service, all previously collected data is deleted within 30 days of license termination.\\\\n-\\\\n-Customers can also remove, export or modify specific data if a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) using the Permissions Management service files an official Data Subject Request. To file a request:\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're an enterprise customer, you can contact your Microsoft representative, account team, or tenant admin to file a high-priority IcM support ticket requesting a Data Subject Request. Do not include details or any personally identifiable information in the IcM request. We'll reach out to you for these details only after an IcM is filed.\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're a self-service customer (you set up a trial or paid license in the Microsoft 365 admin center) you can contact the Permissions Management privacy team by selecting your profile drop-down menu, then **Account Settings** in Permissions Management. Follow the instructions to make a Data Subject Request.\\\\n-\\\\n-Learn more about [Azure Data Subject Requests](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2245178).\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='do-i-require-a-license-to-use-entra-permissions-management-'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Do I require a license to use Microsoft Entra Permissions Management? \\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, as of July 1, 2022, new customers must acquire a free 45-day trial license or a paid license to use the service. You can enable a trial here: [https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement](https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement) or you can directly purchase resource-based licenses here: [https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement](https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement) \\\\n-\\\\n-## How is Permissions Management priced? \\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management is $125 per resources/year ($10.40 per resource/month). Permissions Management requires licenses for workloads, which include any resource that uses compute or memory. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Do I need to pay for all resources?\\\\n-\\\\n-Although Permissions Management supports all resources, Microsoft only requires licenses for billable resources per cloud environment. To learn more about billable resources, visit [View billable resources listed in your authorization system](product-data-billable-resources.md)\\\\n-\\\\n-## How do I calculate the number of billable resources I have? \\\\n-\\\\n-To calculate the billable resources you have across your multicloud infrastructure, you must first activate a [45-day free trial](https://aka.ms/TryPermissionsManagement) of Permissions Management or [purchase a paid license](https://aka.ms/BuyPermissionsManagement). In Permissions Management, select **Settings** (gear icon), then click the **Billable Resources** tab. View the amount of billable resources in the **Total Number of Licenses** column.\\\\n-\\\\n-## What do I do if I’m using the legacy version of the CloudKnox service?  \\\\n-\\\\n-We are currently working on developing a migration plan to help customers on the original CloudKnox service move to the new Microsoft Entra Permissions Management service later in 2022.   \\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='can-i-use-entra-permissions-management-in-the-eu--'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Can I use Microsoft Entra Permissions Management in the EU?  \\\\n-\\\\n-Yes, the product is compliant.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## How to I enable one of the new 18 languages supported in the GA release? \\\\n-\\\\n-We are now localized in 18 languages.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer who uses the AWS IAM Identity Center, you can configure the Identity Center as an identity provider in Permissions Management. Configuring your AWS IAM Identity Center information allows you to receive more accurate data for your identities in Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Configuring AWS IAM Identity Center as an identity provider is an optional step. By configuring identity provider information, Permissions Management can read user and role access configured at AWS IAM Identity Center. Admins can see the augmented view of assigned permissions to the identities. You can return to these steps to configure an IdP at any time.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How to configure AWS IAM Identity Center as an identity provider\\\\n-\\\\n-1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches, select **Settings** (gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-2. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **AWS**, and then select **Create Configuration**. If a Data Collector already exists in your AWS account and you want to add AWS IAM integration, then: \\\\n-    - Select the Data Collector for which you want to configure AWS IAM. \\\\n-    - Click on the ellipsis next to the **Authorization Systems Status**. \\\\n-    - Select **Integrate Identity Provider**. \\\\n-\\\\n-3. On the **Integrate Identity provider (IdP)** page, select the box for **AWS IAM Identity Center**. \\\\n-\\\\n-4. Fill in the following fields:\\\\n-    - The **AWS IAM Identity Center Region**. Specify the region where AWS IAM Identity Center is installed. All data configured in the IAM Identity Center  \\\\n-    is stored in the Region where the IAM Identity Center is installed.   \\\\n-    - Your **AWS Management Account ID**\\\\n-    - Your **AWS Management Account Role**\\\\n-\\\\n-5. Select **Launch Management Account Template**. The template opens in a new window. \\\\n-6. If the Management Account stack is created with the CloudFormation Template as part of the previous onboarding steps, update the stack by running ``EnableSSO`` as true. Running this command creates a new stack when running the Management Account Template. \\\\n-\\\\n-The template execution attaches the AWS managed policy  ``AWSSSOReadOnly`` and the newly created custom policy ``SSOPolicy`` to the AWS IAM role that allows Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to collect organizational information. The following details are requested in the template. All fields are prepopulated, and you can edit the data as you need: \\\\n-- **Stack name** – The Stack name is the name of the AWS stack for creating the required AWS resources for Permissions Management to collect organizational information. The default value is ``mciem-org-<tenant-id>``. \\\\n-\\\\n-- **CFT Parameters**\\\\n-    - **OIDC Provider Role Name** – Name of the IAM Role OIDC Provider that can assume the role. The default value is the OIDC account role (as entered in Permissions Management).\\\\n-\\\\n-    - **Org Account Role Name** - Name of the IAM Role. The default value is prepopulated with the Management account role name (as entered in Microsoft Entra PM).\\\\n-\\\\n-    - **true** – Enables AWS SSO. The default value is ``true`` when the template is launched from the Configure Identity Provider (IdP) page, otherwise the default is ``false``. \\\\n-\\\\n-    - **OIDC Provider Account ID** – The Account ID where the OIDC Provider is created.

Custom RegEx expression for group syntax is not supported.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How to configure Okta as an identity provider\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Log in to the Okta portal with API Access Management Administrator. \\\\n-2. Create a new **Okta API Services Application**. \\\\n-3. In the Admin Console, go to Applications. \\\\n-4. On the Create a new app integration page, select **API Services**.\\\\n-5. Enter a name for your app integration and click **Save**. \\\\n-6. Copy the **Client ID** for future use.  \\\\n-7. In the **Client Credentials** section of the General tab, click **Edit** to change the client authentication method. \\\\n-8. Select **Public key/Private key** as the Client authentication method. \\\\n-9. Leave the default **Save keys in Okta**, then click **Add key**. \\\\n-10. Click **Add** and in the **Add a public key** dialog, either paste your own public key or click **Generate new key** to autogenerate a new 2048-bit RSA key. \\\\n-11. Copy **Public Key Id** for future use.  \\\\n-12. Click **Generate new key** and the public and private keys appear in JWK format. \\\\n-13. Click **PEM**. The private key appears in PEM format. \\\\n-    This is your only opportunity to save the private key. Click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the private key and store it somewhere safe. \\\\n-14. Click **Done**. The new public key is now registered with the app and appears in a table in the **PUBLIC KEYS** section of the **General** tab. \\\\n-15. From the Okta API scopes tab, grant these scopes:\\\\n-    - okta.users.read\\\\n-    - okta.groups.read\\\\n-    - okta.apps.read\\\\n-16. Optional. Click the **Application rate limits** tab to adjust the rate-limit capacity percentage for this service application. By default, each new application sets this percentage at 50 percent. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Convert public key to a Base64 string\\\\n-\\\\n-1. See instructions for [using a personal access token (PAT)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249174).\\\\n-\\\\n-### Find your Okta URL (also called an Okta domain)\\\\n-\\\\n-This Okta URL/Okta domain is saved in the AWS secret.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.\\\\n-2. Look for the Okta URL/Okta domain in the global header of the dashboard. \\\\n-Once located, note the Okta URL in an app such as Notepad. You'll need this URL for your next steps. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Configure AWS stack details\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Fill in the following fields on the **CloudFormation Template Specify stack details** screen using the information from your Okta application:\\\\n-    - **Stack name** - A name of our choosing\\\\n-    - **Or URL** Your organization's Okta URL, example: *https://companyname.okta.com*\\\\n-    - **Client Id** - From the **Client Credentials** section of your Okta application\\\\n-    - **Public Key Id** - Click **Add > Generate new key**. The public key is generated \\\\n-    - **Private Key (in PEM format)** - Base64 encoded string of the PEM format of the **Private key**\\\\n-     > [!NOTE]\\\\n-     > You must copy all text in the field before converting to a Base64 string, including the dash before BEGIN PRIVATE KEY and after END PRIVATE KEY.\\\\n-2. When the **CloudFormation Template Specify stack details** screen is complete, click **Next**.\\\\n-3. On the **Configure stack options** screen, click **Next**.\\\\n-4. Review the information you've entered, then click **Submit**.\\\\n-5. Select the **Resources** tab, then copy the **Physical ID** (this ID is the Secret ARN) for future use.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Configure Okta in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Integrating Okta as an identity provider is an optional step. You can return to these steps to configure an IdP at any time. \\\\n-\\\\n-1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches, select **Settings** (gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.\\\\n-2. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **AWS**, and then select **Create Configuration**.\\\\n-    Complete the **Manage Authorization System** steps.\\\\n-    > [!NOTE]\\\\n-    > If a Data Collector already exists in your AWS account and you want to add Okta integration, follow these steps:\\\\n-    >  1. Select the Data Collector for which you want to add Okta integration.\\\\n-    >  1. Click on the ellipsis next to the **Authorization System Status**.\\\\n-    >  1. Select **Integrate Identity Provider**.\\\\n-\\\\n-3. On the **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page, select the box for **Okta**.\\\\n-4. Select **Launch CloudFormation Template**. The template opens in a new window.\\\\n-   > [!NOTE]\\\\n-   > Here you'll fill in information to create a secret Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that you'll enter on the **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page. Microsoft does not read or store this ARN.\\\\n-5. Return to the Permissions Management **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page and paste the **Secret ARN** in the field provided.\\\\n-6. Click **Next** to review and confirm the information you've entered.\\\\n-7. Click **Verify Now & Save**.\\\\n-   The system returns the populated AWS CloudFormation Template. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- For information on how to view existing roles/policies, requests, and permissions, see [View roles/policies, requests, and permission in the Remediation dashboard](ui-remediation.md).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"587bea11ab89f3ebfccf69bfc52b2e3d926c1194\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/how-to-configure-servicenow-application.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 62,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 62,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fhow-to-configure-servicenow-application.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fhow-to-configure-servicenow-application.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fhow-to-configure-servicenow-application.md?ref=f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,62 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: Configure the ServiceNow application with Permissions Management\\\\n-description: How to configure ServiceNow with Microsoft Entra Permissions Management.\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n-ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n-ms.custom: sfi-image-nochange\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Configure the ServiceNow app for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire). \\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is retiring on October 01, 2025, with new purchases unavailable starting April 1, 2025. Existing paid customers will continue to have access to Permissions Management between April 1, 2025 - September 30, 2025. \\\\n-\\\\n-On October 01, 2025, Permissions Management will be automatically offboarded and associated data collection will be deleted. For customers needing to offboard before October 1, 2025, refer to the [Offboarding steps](#offboarding-steps) section in this guide. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Why is Permissions Management being retired? \\\\n-\\\\n-The decision to phase out Microsoft Entra Permissions Management from the Microsoft Security portfolio was made after deep consideration of our innovation portfolio and how we can focus on delivering the best innovations aligned to our differentiating areas and partners with the ecosystem on adjacencies. We remain committed to delivering top-tier solutions across the Microsoft Entra portfolio, which includes Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Suite (encompassing ID Protection, ID Governance, Verified ID, Internet Access, and Private Access), Microsoft Entra External ID, Microsoft Entra Workload ID, and more.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Recommended solutions\\\\n-\\\\n-Since Permissions Management is retiring, Microsoft recommends that customers who have onboarded the product in their environment start planning for transition. Customers who are not onboarded should refrain from onboarding.   \\\\n-\\\\n-To support this transition, Microsoft is partnering with [Delinea](https://delinea.com/). Delinea offers a cloud-native, fully Microsoft-compatible Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) solution, Privilege Control for Cloud Entitlements (PCCE). PCCE provides functionality comparable to Permissions Management, including continuous discovery of entitlements that allow you to monitor and adjust access rights for both human and machine identities.  \\\\n-\\\\n-We recommend beginning the shift away from Permissions Management as soon as possible, well before September 30th. We're committed to providing extensive support, alongside our partner, Delinea.  \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Recommended steps before migrating to Delinea\\\\n-\\\\n-To ensure you continue with the CIEM objectives with our recommended partner, we recommend making a note of the following information from your Permissions Management portal: \\\\n-\\\\n-- First, go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview), then click **Permissions Management** from the navigation blade. \\\\n-\\\\n-    - Authorization system IDs which are being monitored across Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Settings (Gear icon)** and select the **Authorization Systems** tab to view list of Authorization system IDs.  \\\\n-    - Groups and users given admin access with the Permissions Management Administrator role in Entra ID. To find this, launch **Entra ID**, select **Roles and Admins**, search for **Permissions Management Administrator role**, select **Assignments**. \\\\n-    - Authorization system-specific access provided to groups through the Permissions Management portal. To find this, launch **Permissions Management** portal, Select **User Management**, then click the **Groups** tab to view all group assignments.  \\\\n-    - Custom reports configured in your environment. To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Reports**, navigate to **Custom Reports**.\\\\n-    - Alerts configured in your environment. To find this, launch the **Permissions Management** portal, select **Alerts** (bell icon), navigate to respective alerts tab.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Offboarding steps\\\\n-\\\\n-Once onboarded to our recommended partner and/or any other vendor, customers can initiate offboarding. Follow these steps in order:  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Remove permissions assigned in AWS, Azure, and GCP.\\\\n-1. Remove the OIDC application for AWS and GCP environments.\\\\n-1. Stop collecting data for your entire list of accounts / subscriptions/ projects by deleting the associated data collectors: This ensures no new data is collected and you'll no longer have access to any historic data.\\\\n-1. Disable user sign-in to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) enterprise application   \\\\n-\\\\n- Continue for detailed guidelines for each of these steps.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Remove permissions assigned in AWS, Azure, and GCP\\\\n-\\\\n-For successful offboarding of your data, remove permissions from your onboarded cloud provider (Azure, AWS, or GCP) and Permissions Management. Any roles and permissions assigned during onboarding should be removed. This ensures your environment is secure with no overprivileged access once your environment is offboarded from Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-Refer to the Data Collector configuration from the Permissions Management portal and select the settings (gear icon). Note down the configuration settings to remove roles and permissions assigned in your respective cloud provider.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## Remove the OIDC application for AWS and GCP environments\\\\n-\\\\n-For AWS and GCP, delete the application created in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center tenant where Permissions Management is enabled. This app was used to set up an OIDC (OpenID Connect) connection to your AWS and GCP environments.   \\\\n-\\\\n-To find the Enterprise Application created which was used to set up OIDC connection to your AWS and GCP environments, follow the below steps: \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE] \\\\n-> User must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) and [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator) role assignments to perform this task. \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n-1. Launch the **Permissions Management** portal.\\\\n-1. Select **Settings** (gear icon), then select the **Data Collectors** tab.\\\\n-1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select your authorization system type:\\\\n-    - **AWS** for Amazon Web Services. \\\\n-    - **GCP** for Google Cloud Platform.\\\\n-1. Select the ellipses **(...)** at the end of the row in the table.\\\\n-1. Select **Edit Configuration**. The app is located under the **Azure App** name.\\\\n-1. Go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\\\\n-1. Navigate to **Entra ID** > **App registrations**. \\\\n-1. Enter the name of the existing application in the search box, and then select the application from the search results.\\\\n-1. From the Overview page, select **Delete**. Read the deletion consequences. Check the box if one appears at the bottom of the pane.\\\\n-1. Select **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete the app. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Stop data collection\\\\n-\\\\n-Stop collecting data for your list of accounts / subscriptions / projects by deleting the associated data collectors. \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> User must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to perform this task.\\\\n-\\\\n-1.

These terms help Permissions Management users navigate through cloud-specific terms and cloud-generic terms.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Commonly used acronyms and terms\\\\n-\\\\n-| Term                  | Definition                                          |\\\\n-|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\\\\n-| ACL                  | Access control list. A list of files or resources that contain information about which users or groups have permission to access those resources or modify those files.    |\\\\n-| ARN                  | Azure Resource Notification    |\\\\n-| Authorization System                   | CIEM supports AWS accounts, Azure Subscriptions, GCP projects as the Authorization systems     |\\\\n-| Authorization System Type                  | Any system that provides the authorizations by assigning the permissions to the identities, resources. CIEM supports AWS, Azure, GCP as the Authorization System Types     |\\\\n-| Cloud security        | A form of cybersecurity that protects data stored online on cloud computing platforms from theft, leakage, and deletion. Includes firewalls, penetration testing, obfuscation, tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and avoiding public internet connections.     |\\\\n-| Cloud storage         | A service model in which data is maintained, managed, and backed up remotely. Available to users over a network.                |\\\\n-| CIAM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Access Management     |\\\\n-| CIEM                 | Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management. The next generation of solutions for enforcing least privilege in the cloud. It addresses cloud-native security challenges of managing identity access management in cloud environments.      |\\\\n-| CIS                  | Cloud infrastructure security      |\\\\n-| CWP                  | Cloud Workload Protection. A workload-centric security solution that targets the unique protection requirements of workloads in modern enterprise environments. |\\\\n-| CNAPP                | Cloud-Native Application Protection. The convergence of cloud security posture management (CSPM), cloud workload protection (CWP), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and cloud applications security broker (CASB). An integrated security approach that covers the entire lifecycle of cloud-native applications. |\\\\n-| CSPM                 | Cloud Security Posture Management. Addresses risks of compliance violations and misconfigurations in enterprise cloud environments. Also focuses on the resource level to identify deviations from best practice security settings for cloud governance and compliance.      |\\\\n-| CWPP                  | Cloud Workload Protection Platform    |\\\\n-| Data Collector | Virtual entity which stores the data collection configuration |\\\\n-| Delete task          | A high-risk task that allows users to permanently delete a resource.     |\\\\n-| ED | Enterprise directory |\\\\n-| Entitlement          | An abstract attribute that represents different forms of user permissions in a range of infrastructure systems and business applications.|\\\\n-| Entitlement management     | Technology that grants, resolves, enforces, revokes, and administers fine-grained access entitlements (that is, authorizations, privileges, access rights, permissions and rules). Its purpose is to execute IT access policies to structured/unstructured data, devices, and services. It can be delivered by different technologies, and is often different across platforms, applications, network components, and devices. |\\\\n-| High-risk permission | Permissions that have the potential to cause data leakage, service disruption and degradation, or changes in security posture. |\\\\n-| High-risk task       | A task in which a user can cause data leakage, service disruption, or service degradation.     |\\\\n-| Hybrid cloud          | Sometimes called a cloud hybrid. A computing environment that combines an on-premises data center (a private cloud) with a public cloud. It allows data and applications to be shared between them.                |\\\\n-| hybrid cloud storage    | A private or public cloud used to store an organization's data.    |\\\\n-| ICM                     | Incident Case Management                     |\\\\n-| IDS                    | Intrusion Detection Service                    |\\\\n-| Identity | An identity is a human identity (user) or workload identity. There are different names and types of workload identities for each cloud. AWS: Lambda function (serverless function), role, resource. Azure: Azure function (serverless function), service principal. GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |\\\\n-| Identity analytics    | Includes basic monitoring and remediation, dormant and orphan account detection and removal, and privileged account discovery. |\\\\n-| Identity lifecycle management | Maintain digital identities, their relationships with the organization, and their attributes during the entire process from creation to eventual archiving, using one or more identity life cycle patterns. |\\\\n-| IGA                   | Identity governance and administration. Technology solutions that conduct identity management and access governance operations. IGA includes the tools, technologies, reports, and compliance activities required for identity lifecycle management. It includes every operation from account creation and termination to user provisioning, access certification, and enterprise password management. It looks at automated workflow and data from authoritative sources capabilities, self-service user provisioning, IT governance, and password management. |\\\\n-| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |\\\\n-| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |\\\\n-| ITSM                     | Information Technology Security Management. Tools that enable IT operations organizations (infrastructure and operations managers), to better support the production environment. Facilitate the tasks and workflows associated with the management and delivery of quality IT services.      |\\\\n-| JEP | Just Enough Permissions |\\\\n-| JIT                    | Just in Time access can be seen as a way to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure users and non-human identities are given the minimum level of privileges. It also ensures that privileged activities are conducted in accordance with an organization's Identity Access Management (IAM), IT Service Management (ITSM), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) policies, with its entitlements and workflows. JIT access strategy enables organizations to maintain a full audit trail of privileged activities so they can easily identify who or what gained access to which systems, what they did at what time, and for how long.     |\\\\n-| Least privilege        | Ensures that users only gain access to the specific tools they need to complete a task.  |\\\\n-| Multi-tenant            | A single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database.                    |\\\\n-| OIDC                    | OpenID Connect. An authentication protocol that verifies user identity when a user is trying to access a protected HTTPS end point. OIDC is an evolutionary development of ideas implemented earlier in OAuth. |\\\\n-| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. | \\\\n-| PAM                   | Privileged access management. Tools that offer one or more of these features: discover, manage, and govern privileged accounts on multiple systems and applications; control access to privileged accounts, including shared and emergency access; randomize, manage, and vault credentials (password, keys, etc.) for administrative, service, and application accounts; single sign-on (SSO) for privileged access to prevent credentials from being revealed; control, filter, and orchestrate privileged commands, actions, and tasks; manage and broker credentials to applications, services, and devices to avoid exposure; and monitor, record, audit, and analyze privileged access, sessions, and actions. |\\\\n-| PASM                  | Privileged accounts are protected by vaulting their credentials. Access to those accounts is then brokered for human users, services, and applications. Privileged session management (PSM) functions establish sessions with possible credential injection and full session recording. Passwords and other credentials for privileged accounts are actively managed and changed at definable intervals or upon the occurrence of specific events. PASM solutions may also provide application-to-application password management (AAPM) and zero-install remote privileged access features for IT staff and third parties that don't require a VPN.  |\\\\n-| PEDM                  | Specific privileges are granted on the managed system by host-based agents to logged-in users. PEDM tools provide host-based command control (filtering); application allow, deny, and isolate controls; and/or privilege elevation. The latter is in the form of allowing particular commands to be run with a higher level of privileges. PEDM tools execute on the actual operating system at the kernel or process level. Command control through protocol filtering is explicitly excluded from this definition because the point of control is less reliable. PEDM tools may also provide file integrity monitoring features. |\\\\n-| Permission            | Rights and privileges. An action an identity can perform on a resource. Details given by users or network administrators that define access rights to files on a network. Access controls attached to a resource dictating which identities can access it and how. Permissions are attached to identities and are the ability to perform certain actions. |\\\\n-| POD                    | Permission on Demand. A type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.      |\\\\n-| Permissions creep index (PCI)    | A number from 0 to 100 that represents the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. PCI is a function of users who have access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them.    |\\\\n-| Policy and role management | Maintain rules that govern automatic assignment and removal of access rights. Provides visibility of access rights for selection in access requests, approval processes, dependencies, and incompatibilities between access rights, and more. Roles are a common vehicle for policy management. |\\\\n-| Privilege             | The authority to make changes to a network or computer. Both people and accounts can have privileges, and both can have different levels of privilege.        |\\\\n-| Privileged account    | A login credential to a server, firewall, or other administrative account. Often referred to as admin accounts. Comprised of the actual username and password; these two things together make up the account. A privileged account is allowed to do more things than a normal account. |\\\\n-| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |\\\\n-| Public Cloud            | Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.                |\\\\n-| Resource              | Any entity that uses compute capabilities can be accessed by users and services to perform actions. |\\\\n-| Role                    | An IAM identity that has specific permissions. Instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. A role doesn't have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with.                  |\\\\n-| SCIM                    | System for Cross–domain Identity Management |\\\\n-| SIEM                    | Security Information and Event Management. Technology that supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through the collection and analysis (both near real time and historical) of security events, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources. The core capabilities are a broad scope of log event collection and management, the ability to analyze log events and other data across disparate sources, and operational capabilities (such as incident management, dashboards, and reporting).      |\\\\n-| SOAR                  | Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR). Technologies that enable organizations to take inputs from various sources (mostly from security information and event management [SIEM] systems) and apply workflows aligned to processes and procedures. These workflows can be orchestrated via integrations with other technologies and automated to achieve the desired outcome and greater visibility. Other capabilities include case and incident management features; the ability to manage threat intelligence, dashboards and reporting; and analytics that can be applied across various functions. SOAR tools significantly enhance security operations activities like threat detection and response by providing machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes.    |\\\\n-| Super user / Super identity     | A powerful account used by IT system administrators that can be used to make configurations to a system or application, add or remove users, or delete data. Super users and identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account).   |\\\\n-| Tenant                | A dedicated instance of the services and organization data stored within a specific default location.                  |\\\\n-| UUID                    | Universally unique identifier. A 128-bit label used for information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used.|\\\\n-| Used permissions | The number of permissions used by an identity in the last 90 days. |\\\\n-| Zero trust security    | The three foundational principles: explicit verification, breach assumption, and least privileged access.|\\\\n-| ZTNA                   | Zero trust network access. A product or service that creates an identity- and context-based, logical access boundary around an application or set of applications. The applications are hidden from discovery, and access is restricted via a trust broker to a set of named entities. The broker verifies the identity, context and policy adherence of the specified participants before allowing access and prohibits lateral movement elsewhere in the network. It removes application assets from public visibility and significantly reduces the surface area for attack.|\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- For an overview of Permissions Management, see [What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?](overview.md).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"f6df0a23228313a72c46a7cea97b30864e344b35\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/onboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 109,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 109,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fonboard-add-account-after-onboarding.md?ref=f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,109 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: Add an account/subscription/project to Permissions Management after onboarding is complete\\\\n-description: How to add an account/subscription/project to Permissions Management after onboarding is complete.\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n-\\\\n-ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Add an account/ subscription/ project after onboarding is complete\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-This article describes how to onboard a Microsoft Azure subscription or subscriptions on Permissions Management. Onboarding a subscription creates a new authorization system to represent the Azure subscription in Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> You must be a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) to perform the tasks in this article.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Explanation\\\\n-\\\\n-The Permissions Management service is built on Azure, and given you're onboarding your Azure subscriptions to be monitored and managed, setup is simple with few moving parts to configure. Below is what is required to configure onboarding:\\\\n-\\\\n-* When your tenant is onboarded, an application is created in the tenant.\\\\n-* This app requires 'reader' permissions on the subscriptions\\\\n-* For controller functionality, the app requires 'User Access Administrator' to create and implement right-size roles\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-To add Permissions Management to your Microsoft Entra tenant:\\\\n-- You must have a Microsoft Entra user account and an Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) on your system, or an Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).\\\\n-- You must have **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission at the subscription or management group scope to perform these tasks. If you don't have this permission, you can ask someone who has this permission to perform these tasks for you.\\\\n-\\\\n-## How to onboard an Azure subscription\\\\n-\\\\n-1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches:\\\\n-\\\\n-    - In the Permissions Management home page, select **Settings** (the gear icon, top right), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **Azure**, and then select **Create Configuration**.\\\\n-\\\\n-### 1. Add Azure subscription details\\\\n-\\\\n-Choose from three options to manage Azure subscriptions. \\\\n-\\\\n-#### Option 1: Automatically manage \\\\n-\\\\n-This option lets subscriptions be automatically detected and monitored without further work required. A key benefit of automatic management is that any current or future subscriptions found are onboarded automatically. The steps to detect a list of subscriptions and onboard for collection are as follows:  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Firstly, grant Reader role to Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application at management group or subscription scope. To do this:  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the EPM portal, left-click the cog on the top right-hand side.  \\\\n-1. Go to data collectors tab \\\\n-1. Ensure **Azure** is selected.\\\\n-1. Click **Create Configuration.**\\\\n-1.

CIEM is a critical component of a Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) solution providing visibility into who has access to what resources and ensuring access rights align with the principle of least privilege (PoLP), where users have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks.  \\\\n- \\\\n-Microsoft delivers both CNAPP and CIEM solutions with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CNAPP) and Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (CIEM). While both Defender for Cloud and Permissions Management help secure customers’ cloud environments, they're two distinct security solutions that address different aspects of cloud security. Permissions Management focuses on managing and enforcing fine-grained access controls, permissions, and entitlements for identities across multicloud infrastructures. Defender for Cloud focuses on securing cloud-native applications such as containers, microservices, and serverless applications through visibility into application behavior and security posture.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## How Permissions Management works with Defender for Cloud\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management capabilities are available to integrate into the Defender for Cloud CSPM plan. Adding the capabilities of Permissions Management to Defender for Cloud strengthens the prevention of security breaches that might occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. These added features make Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Permissions Management and Defender for Cloud capabilities\\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud/permissions-management-defender-for-cloud-comparison.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A table showing the difference in capabilities of Permissions Management and Defender for Cloud.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud/permissions-management-defender-for-cloud-comparison.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Common use cases and scenarios\\\\n-\\\\n-With the added capabilities of Permissions Management, you can track permissions analytics, unused permissions for active identities, and over-permissioned identities then act to mitigate them to support the best practice of least privilege in Defender for Cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- For instructions on how to enable Permissions Management in your Defender for Cloud environment, see [Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252561).\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"38229458421e825dc0891ac42eaac806f50ecb25\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/permissions-management/permissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"removed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 196,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 196,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fpermissions-management%2Fpermissions-management-quickstart-guide.md?ref=f60c40547017684301b31ed4d6a5d3b146b0d3fd\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -1,196 +0,0 @@\\\\n----\\\\n-title: Microsoft Entra Permissions Management Quickstart Guide\\\\n-description: Quickstart guide - How to quickly onboard your Microsoft Entra Permissions Management product\\\\n-author: jenniferf-skc\\\\n-manager: pmwongera\\\\n-ms.service: entra-permissions-management\\\\n-ms.topic: quickstart\\\\n-ms.date: 04/01/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jfields\\\\n-ms.custom: sfi-image-nochange\\\\n-# CustomerIntent: As a security administrator, I want to successfully onboard Permissions Management so that I can enable identity security in my cloud environment as efficiently as possible.'\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Quickstart guide to Microsoft Entra Permissions Management \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product.

These identities include over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management helps your organization effectively secure and manage cloud permissions by detecting, automatically right-sizing, and continuously monitoring unused and excessive permissions. \\\\n-\\\\n-With this quickstart guide, you’ll set up your multicloud environment(s), configure data collection, and enable permissions access to ensure your cloud identities are managed and secure.  \\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites \\\\n-\\\\n-Before you begin, you need access to these tools for the onboarding process: \\\\n-\\\\n-- Access to a local BASH shell with the Azure CLI or Azure Cloud Shell using BASH environment (Azure CLI is included). \\\\n-- Access to AWS, Azure, and GCP consoles.\\\\n-- A user must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to create a new app registration in Microsoft Entra tenant is required for AWS and GCP onboarding. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 1: Set-up Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-To enable Permissions Management, you must have a Microsoft Entra tenant (example, Microsoft Entra admin center).  \\\\n-- If you have an Azure account, you automatically have a Microsoft Entra admin center tenant. \\\\n-- If you don’t already have one, create a free account at [entra.microsoft.com.](https://entra.microsoft.com)\\\\n-\\\\n-If the above points are met, continue with:\\\\n-\\\\n-[Enable Microsoft Entra Permissions Management in your organization](onboard-enable-tenant.md)\\\\n-\\\\n-Ensure you're a [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator). Learn more about [Permissions Management roles and permissions](product-roles-permissions.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-roles-sync-azure-environment.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A diagram showing where Microsoft Entra intersect with Azure roles in the Microsoft Entra tenant.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-roles-sync-azure-environment.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n- \\\\n-## Step 2: Onboard your multicloud environment\\\\n-\\\\n-So far you’ve,  \\\\n-\\\\n-1. Been assigned the *Permissions Management Administrator* role in your Microsoft Entra admin center tenant. \\\\n-2. Purchased licenses or activated your 45-day free trial for Permissions Management. \\\\n-3. Successfully launched Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-Now, you're going to learn about the role and settings of the Controller and Data collection modes in Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Set the controller \\\\n-The controller gives you the choice to determine the level of access you grant to users in Permissions Management.  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Enabling the controller during onboarding grants Permissions Management admin access, or read and write access, so users can right-size permissions and remediate directly through Permissions Management (instead of going to the AWS, Azure, or GCP consoles).  \\\\n-\\\\n-- Disabling the controller during onboarding, or never enabling it, grants a Permissions Management user read-only access to your environment(s).  \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> If you don't enable the controller during onboarding, you have the option to enable it after onboarding is complete. To set the controller in Permissions Management after onboarding, see [Enable or disable the controller after onboarding](onboard-enable-controller-after-onboarding.md).\\\\n-> For AWS environments, once you have enabled the controller, you *cannot* disable it. \\\\n-\\\\n-To set the controller settings during onboarding:\\\\n-1. Select **Enable** to give read and write access to Permissions Management.\\\\n-2. Select **Disable** to give read-only access to Permissions Management.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Configure data collection\\\\n-\\\\n-There are three modes to choose from in order to collect data in Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-- **Automatic (recommended)** \\\\n-Permissions Management automatically discovers, onboards, and monitors all current and future subscriptions. \\\\n-\\\\n-- **Manual** \\\\n-Manually enter individual subscriptions for Permissions Management to discover, onboard, and monitor. You can enter up to 100 subscriptions per data collection.  \\\\n-\\\\n-- **Select** \\\\n-Permissions Management automatically discovers all current subscriptions. Once discovered, you select which subscriptions to onboard and monitor. \\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE] \\\\n-> To use **Automatic** or **Select** modes, the controller must be enabled while configuring data collection. \\\\n-\\\\n-To configure data collection:\\\\n-1. In Permissions Management, go to the **Data Collectors** page.\\\\n-2. Select a cloud environment: **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**.\\\\n-3. Click **Create configuration**.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The data collection process takes some time and occurs in approximately 4-5 hour intervals in most cases. The time frame depends on the size of the authorization system you have and how much data is available for collection.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### Onboard Amazon Web Services (AWS)\\\\n-Since Permissions Management is hosted on Microsoft Entra, there are more steps to take to onboard your AWS environment.  \\\\n-\\\\n-To connect AWS to Permissions Management, you must create a Microsoft Entra application in the Microsoft Entra admin center tenant where Permissions Management is enabled. This Microsoft Entra application is used to set up an OIDC connection to your AWS environment.\\\\n-\\\\n-*OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications.*\\\\n-\\\\n-:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-tenant-amazon-web-service-connection.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"A diagram showing the connection between Microsoft Entra ID and an AWS cloud environment.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/permissions-management-quickstart-guide/entra-id-tenant-amazon-web-service-connection.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### Prerequisites \\\\n-\\\\n-A user must have the [Permissions Management Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#permissions-management-administrator) role assignment to create a new app registration in Microsoft Entra ID. \\\\n-\\\\n-Account IDs and roles for: \\\\n-- AWS OIDC account: An AWS member account designated by you to create and host the OIDC connection through an OIDC IdP\\\\n-- AWS Logging account (optional but recommended) \\\\n-- AWS Management account (optional but recommended)  \\\\n-- AWS member accounts monitored and managed by Permissions Management (for manual mode) \\\\n-\\\\n-To use **Automatic** or **Select** data collection modes, you must connect your AWS Management account.  \\\\n-\\\\n-During this step, you can enable the controller by entering the name of the S3 bucket with AWS CloudTrail activity logs (found on AWS Trails). \\\\n-\\\\n-To onboard your AWS environment and configure data collection, see [Onboard an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](onboard-aws.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-### Onboard Microsoft Azure\\\\n-When you enabled Permissions Management in the Microsoft Entra tenant, an enterprise application for CIEM was created. To onboard your Azure environment, you grant permissions to this application for Permissions management.\\\\n-\\\\n-1.

There are different names and types of workload identities for each cloud. AWS: Lambda function (serverless function), role, resource. Azure: Azure function (serverless function), service principal. GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |\\\\n-| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |\\\\n-| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |\\\\n-| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. |  \\\\n-| Permission | A permission is an action an identity can perform on a resource. |\\\\n-| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |\\\\n-| Super identity | Super identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account). |\\\\n-| Used permissions | The number of permissions used by an identity in the last 90 days. |\\\\n-\\\\n-<!---## Add and remove tags in the Permissions analytics report\\\\n-\\\\n-1.

The goal of this alert trigger is a high recall rate.\\\\n-\\\\n-You can configure statistical anomaly alert triggers for the following scenarios:\\\\n-- **Identity Performed High Number of Tasks**: The identity performs higher than their usual volume of tasks. For example, an identity typically performs 25 tasks per day, and now it is performing 100 tasks per day.\\\\n-- **Identity Performed Low Number of Tasks**: The identity performs lower than their usual volume of tasks. For example, an identity typically performs 100 tasks per day, and now it is performing 25 tasks per day.\\\\n-- **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Results**: The identity performing an action gets a different result than usual, such as most tasks end in a successful result and are now ending in a failed result or vice versa.\\\\n-- **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Timing**: The identity does tasks at unusual times as established by their baseline in the observance period. Times are grouped by the following UTC 4-hour windows.\\\\n-- **Identity Performed Tasks with Unusual Types**: The identity performs unusual types of tasks as established by their baseline in the observance period. For example, an identity performs read, write, or delete tasks they wouldn't ordinarily perform.\\\\n-- **Identity Performed Tasks with Multiple Unusual Patterns**: The identity has several unusual patterns in the tasks performed by the identity as established by their baseline in the observance period.\\\\n-\\\\n-Alert triggers are based on data collected. All alerts, if triggered, are shown every hour under the Alerts subtab.\\\\n-\\\\n-## View statistical anomalies in an identity's behavior\\\\n-You can view statistical anomalies in an identity's behavior to monitor unusual activities in Permissions Management.

More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).\\\\n-\\\\n-This article provides the latest Public Preview and General Availability information of features in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. \\\\n-\\\\n-## May 2024\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration for Microsoft Defender for Cloud\\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become the norm. Ensuring the security of cloud applications and infrastructure requires integrating identity and permission insights into the overall security strategy. This objective is achieved through the integration of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management capabilities are available to integrate into the Defender for Cloud CSPM plan. Adding the capabilities of [Permissions Management to Defender for Cloud](permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud.md) strengthens the prevention of security breaches that might occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. These added features make Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud. \\\\n-\\\\n-For instructions on how to enable Permissions Management in your Defender for Cloud environment, see [Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2252561)\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - Support for PIM-enabled Groups \\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups in Microsoft Entra ID allows Permissions Management admins to grant users just-in-time membership and ownership of a security group or a Microsoft 365 group. Nested groups are also supported. For example, if a user is an active member of Group A, and Group A is an eligible member of Group B, the user can activate their membership in Group B. PIM provides a powerful mechanism to manage access and enhance security by granting just-in-time access to critical resources. \\\\n-\\\\n-Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership along with existing support for direct group membership. It also solves the challenge of having visibility into who has access to what resource with eligible and direct role assignments. This feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways and the potential impact on Permissions Creep Index (PCI). A complete list of RBAC role assignments is provisioned directly, via the group membership or by an eligible group member, and can be seen per identity under the Analytics tab. \\\\n-\\\\n-## March 2024\\\\n-\\\\n-### Public Preview - Support for PIM-enabled Groups \\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-As multiple customers embrace PIM for groups as a popular feature, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership impact on the eligible granted Azure RBAC permissions and Permissions Creep Index (PCI). The feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways.  \\\\n- \\\\n-In the Permissions Management console, admins can see the membership eligibility status as well as role eligibility status for Groups. For each identity, admins can get the visibility into the membership eligibility status as well as roles eligibility status. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## December 2023\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - Permissions Analytics Report PDF\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                      \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management  \\\\n-\\\\n-The [Permissions Analytics Report (PAR)](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). \\\\n-\\\\n-The PAR PDF is one part of the overall reporting redesign effort led by the engineering team. As part of this feature release, customers can download all reports (system or custom) with no row limitations in CSV and XSLX formats. \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## October 2023\\\\n-\\\\n-### Public preview - Permissions Analytics Report PDF for multiple authorization systems\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** Changed feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                        \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management            \\\\n-\\\\n-The Permissions Analytics Report (PAR) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  \\\\n-\\\\n-The PAR PDF has a new design to enhance usability, align with the product UX redesign effort, and address various customer feature requests. [You can download the PAR PDF for up to 10 authorization systems](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-### General availability - ServiceNow app for Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** New feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                        \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-The ServiceNow Application for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management enables users to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) through the ServiceNow portal. This integration aids organizations in enhancing their Zero Trust posture by enforcing the principle of least privilege for multicloud permissions. The ServiceNow app streamlines access permission requests within existing approval workflows.  \\\\n-\\\\n-Get the ServiceNow app in the [ServiceNow app store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/24073ae31bfca9100e564082b24bcb56/1.0.1?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%25253Bgenerative_ai%25253Bsnow_solution%26q%3Dentra%2520permissions%2520management&sl=sh). \\\\n-\\\\n-### Public preview - Okta and AWS Identity Center identity provider integrations\\\\n-\\\\n-**Type:** New feature   \\\\n-**Service category:**                        \\\\n-**Product capability:** Permissions Management\\\\n-\\\\n-Permissions Management supports third party identity providers (IdP) integration to get more insight of single sign-on data of permissions assigned in cloud environments. With this information, Permissions Management can provide more accurate analytics. By reading role assignments and user data from the IdP side, Permissions Management more effectively calculates permissions granted, and as a result, reads more precise data on permissions creep. \\\\n-\\\\n-For [Okta Identity Provider integration](how-to-configure-okta-as-an-identity-provider.md), an admin needs to configure the API application to give the access to read Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. Permissions Management reads Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. \\\\n-\\\\n-For [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center integration](how-to-configure-aws-iam.md), an admin can provide Permissions Management access to read user and role access configuration data from the management account by running the CloudFormation template (CFT) in their AWS environment. After successful configuration, Permissions Management can read the data to calculate the analytics.\\\\n-\\\"\\r\\n  }\\r\\n].

This change is actively rolling out to all tenants in production by end of October. \\\\n+\\\\n+**What’s New**\\\\n+\\\\n+- **SMS Authentication for Password Reset:** End users can now verify their identity via SMS when using the *“forgot password”* or self-service password reset flow. Previously, only email one-time passcodes were supported.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Enhanced Security:** If users have two or more registered methods for password reset, they'll now be required to verify their identity with at least two methods, adding an extra layer of protection.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Fraud Protection:** With built-in integration to the Phone Reputation platform, telephony activity is processed in real time to identify risks. Each request is returned with an Allow, Block, or Challenge decision to help protect against telephony fraud.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Billing:** SMS for password reset is a part of add-on feature with tiered pricing based on location/region. Charges per SMS include the fraud protection services.

This new application will manifest as a first party service principal called the \\\\\\\"Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service\\\\\\\" (Application ID: 6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016) and will be visible in the Enterprise Applications experience within the Microsoft Entra admin center. This application is critical for the continued operation of on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID synchronization functionality through Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Connect now uses this first party application to synchronize between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Customers are required to upgrade to version **2.5.79.0** or later by **September 2026**. \\\\n+\\\\n+We'll auto-upgrade customers where supported. For customers who wish to be auto-upgraded, [ensure that you have auto-upgrade configured](../identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md).  \\\\n+\\\\n+The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change is exclusively available on Microsoft Entra admin center under [Microsoft Entra Connect](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/~/GetStarted).\\\\n+\\\\n+Check our [version history page](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history.md) for more details on available versions.\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - App management policies portal experience\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Enterprise Apps    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Directory    \\\\n+\\\\n+App management policies allow administrators to improve the security of their organization by setting rules on how applications in their organization can be configured. They can use them to block insecure configurations like password credentials. These policies have been available through the Microsoft Graph API, but can now also be configured using the Microsoft Entra admin center, under the Enterprise applications experience.\\\\n+\\\\n+Learn more about [how to configure app management policies](https://aka.ms/app-mgmt-policy-ux-docs).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Delegate approvals in My Access\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Entitlement Management    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Entitlement Management    \\\\n+\\\\n+Users can now delegate their access package approvals in My Access.

After detecting inactivity, the workflow automatically executes predefined tasks—such as sending inactivity notifications, disabling accounts, or initiating offboarding—for users that exceed the inactivity threshold. Admins can configure the inactivity threshold and scope, ensuring dormant accounts are handled efficiently and consistently - reducing security exposure, reducing license waste, and enforcing governance policies at scale.\\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see: [Manage inactive users using Lifecycle Workflows (Preview)](../id-governance/lifecycle-workflow-inactive-users.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Retirement - Microsoft Authentication Library to MSAL Recommendations API\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** Deprecated    \\\\n+**Service category:** Other    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Developer Experience    \\\\n+\\\\n+We’re retiring the **ADAL to MSAL Recommendations API** on **December 15, 2025**.\\\\n+\\\\n+To continue monitoring authentication library usage, customers can query sign-in logs manually via **Microsoft Graph API**.

Existing apps already configured with this feature continues to work, but it will no longer be available for new configurations. Going forward, admins should use the “*Capture sign-in fields for an app*”. This requires the MyApps Secure Sign-In Extension, available for Microsoft Edge and Chrome. \\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see: [Capture sign-in fields for an app](../identity/enterprise-apps/troubleshoot-password-based-sso.md#capture-sign-in-fields-for-an-app) \\\\n+\\\\n+To learn about our passwordless strategy, see:[Passwordless is here and at scale](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/passwordless-is-here-and-at-scale/2810639).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Global Secure Access Internet profile support for iOS client\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Internet Access    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Network Access    \\\\n+\\\\n+We're excited to announce the Internet Access support with iOS app. This feature protects access to internet and SaaS apps with an identity-based Secure Web Gateway (SWG), blocking threats, unsafe content, and malicious traffic from the iPhones and iPads.\\\\n+\\\\n+Global Secure Access client on mobile platforms requires no new agent installation/deployment for secure access to their resources, and uses existing MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) to route traffic through Microsoft SSE for both Microsoft 365, internet access and private access.\\\\n+\\\\n+For more information, see: [Global Secure Access client for iOS (Preview)](../global-secure-access/how-to-install-ios-client.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Public Preview - Basic HTML support in Lifecycle Workflow custom email notifications\\\\n+\\\\n+**Type:** New feature    \\\\n+**Service category:** Lifecycle Workflows    \\\\n+**Product capability:** Identity Governance    \\\\n+\\\\n+Now customers can further customize their Lifecycle workflows email notifications to personalize, or emphasize, specific information using basic HTML elements.

To enable secure collaboration, resource tenants can grant users from other organizations access to their resources. Traditional solutions for external access often lack visibility and granular security controls.\\\\n+\\\\n+Global Secure Access, built into Microsoft Entra, addresses these challenges by leveraging existing B2B guest identities. This integration provides enhanced security features, including full Conditional Access, Continuous Access Evaluation, and cross-tenant trust, helping organizations manage and secure external user access more effectively.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Enable B2B guest access for Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365\\\\n+\\\\n+You can enable Global Secure Access on Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop instances that support external identities to provide B2B guest access. With this capability, external users—such as guests, partners, and contractors—from other organizations can securely access resources in your tenant (the resource tenant). As a resource tenant administrator, you can configure Private Access, Internet Access, and Microsoft 365 traffic policies for these third-party users, helping ensure secure and controlled access to your organization's resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+[![Diagram showing an overview of B2B guest access in Global Secure Access.](media/concept-b2b-guest-access/guest-access-overview.png)](media/concept-b2b-guest-access/guest-access-overview.png#lightbox)\\\\n+\\\\n+To enable B2B guest access for Windows 365 or Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) virtual machines using Global Secure Access, follow these steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Configure your Windows 365 or Azure Virtual Desktop VM instance to use external ID linking. Learn more in [Configure external ID linking](/azure/virtual-desktop/authentication#external-identity).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Onboard your organization to Global Secure Access. See [onboarding instructions](/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access#licensing-overview).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Set up one or more Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles and assign them to users with external IDs. Learn more in [Configure traffic forwarding profiles](/entra/global-secure-access/quickstart-access-admin-center) and [Assign users to profiles](/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Install and configure the Global Secure Access client on the virtual machines. See [Installation guide for the Global Secure Access client](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client).\\\\n+\\\\n+Once configured, the Global Secure Access client automatically connects to the tenant associated with the VM instance using the external ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Related content\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md)\\\\n+- [Global Secure Access client for Android](how-to-install-android-client.md)\\\\n+- [Global Secure Access client for macOS](how-to-install-macos-client.md)\\\\n+- [Global Secure Access client for iOS](how-to-install-ios-client.md)\\\\n+- [Client for Windows version release notes](reference-windows-client-release-history.md)\\\\n+- [Known limitations](/entra/global-secure-access/reference-current-known-limitations#b2b-guest-access-limitations)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"e0cabc7e0157822f0ee02c92ee4c518a354c4519\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/media/concept-b2b-guest-access/guest-access-overview.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/db355f30fc38b3641f07db65cd091ed9b767b096/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fmedia%2Fconcept-b2b-guest-access%2Fguest-access-overview.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/db355f30fc38b3641f07db65cd091ed9b767b096/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fmedia%2Fconcept-b2b-guest-access%2Fguest-access-overview.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fmedia%2Fconcept-b2b-guest-access%2Fguest-access-overview.png?ref=db355f30fc38b3641f07db65cd091ed9b767b096\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"57bd5261b39eaa918cbf2ca7f4a10a9f1fa22d52\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/reference-current-known-limitations.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 5,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 6,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/db355f30fc38b3641f07db65cd091ed9b767b096/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Freference-current-known-limitations.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/db355f30fc38b3641f07db65cd091ed9b767b096/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Freference-current-known-limitations.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Freference-current-known-limitations.md?ref=db355f30fc38b3641f07db65cd091ed9b767b096\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -5,7 +5,7 @@ author: HULKsmashGithub\\\\n ms.topic: reference\\\\n ms.author: jayrusso\\\\n manager: dougeby\\\\n-ms.date: 09/08/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 09/23/2025\\\\n ms.service: global-secure-access\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n@@ -268,3 +268,7 @@ Known limitations for Internet Access include:\\\\n -

For example, even if an attacker manages to reset a user's password using the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent, they still can't bypass the second factor.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n@@ -53,10 +53,10 @@ A group Managed Service Account is a managed domain account that provides automa\\\\n \\\\n ### Prerequisites for gMSA\\\\n \\\\n-1.

Key changes include:\n\n*   **Error Code Documentation:** The `docs/identity-platform/reference-error-codes.md` file has been updated to correct a link in the AADSTS50124 error description and to add new error codes AADSTS240003 and AADSTS240004.\n*   **Server Version Requirements:** Multiple files within the `docs/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync` and `docs/identity/hybrid/connect` directories have been updated to reflect a preference for Windows Server 2022, 2019, or 2016, shifting away from solely referencing Windows Server 2016 as the minimum. This includes updates to prerequisites for Microsoft Entra Connect, cloud sync agents, and provisioning agents.\n*   **Date Updates:** Several `ms.date` metadata fields have been advanced to later dates, suggesting ongoing content reviews and updates.",

barclayn\\\\n-# Customer intent: As a developer, I'm looking for information about the open standards that are supported by Microsoft Entra Verified ID.\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Configure Verified ID by AU10TIX as your Identity Verification Partner\\\\n-\\\\n-In this article, we cover the steps needed to integrate Microsoft Entra Verified ID with [AU10TIX](https://www.au10tix.com/). AU10TIX is an automated solution for the verification of ID documents + biometrics. AU10TIX supports the verification of documents in over 190 regions reading documents in their regional languages.\\\\n-\\\\n-To learn more about AU10TIX and its complete set of solutions, visit https://www.au10tix.com/.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n- You need to meet the following requirements before you can continue with the steps in this article:\\\\n-\\\\n-- A tenant [configured](verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant.md) for Microsoft Entra Verified ID service.\\\\n-    - If you don't have an existing tenant, you can [create an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).\\\\n-- You first need to complete the onboarding process with Au10tix.\\\\n-    - To create a AU10TIX account, submit the form on this [page](https://www.au10tix.com/solutions/verifiable-credentials/).\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> Before you proceed, you must have a URL from Au10Tix for users to be issued Verified IDs. If you don't have it, follow up with Au10Tix before you attempt to follow the steps in this article.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Scenario description\\\\n-\\\\n-When onboarding users you can remove the need for error prone manual onboarding steps by using Verified ID with A10TIX account onboarding. Verified IDs can be used to digitally onboard employees, students, citizens, or others to securely access resources and services. For example, rather than an employee needing to go to a central office to activate an employee badge, they can use a Verified ID to verify their identity to activate a badge that is delivered to them remotely. Rather than a citizen receiving a code they must redeem to access governmental services, they can use a Verified ID to prove their identity and gain access.

To request Verified IDs from your users, include the request URL and body in your application or website. \\\\n-   >[!Note]\\\\n-   >If you are using [one of the sample apps](https://aka.ms/vcsample), you'll need to replace the contents of the `presentation_request_config.json` with the request body obtained in [Part 1](#part-1). The sample code overwrites the `trustedIssuers` values with `IssuerAuthority` value from `appsettings.json`. Copy the `trustedIssuers` value from the payload to `IssuerAuthority` in `appsettings.json` file.\\\\n-1.

They're simple to deploy and maintain, and powerful. This article explains what connectors are, how they work, and how to optimize your deployment.\\\\n \\\\n ## What is a private network connector?\\\\n \\\\n-Connectors are lightweight agents that sit in a private network and facilitate the outbound connection to the Microsoft Entra Private Access and application proxy services. Connectors must be installed on a Windows Server that has access to the backend resources. You can organize connectors into connector groups, with each group handling traffic to specific resources. For more information on application proxy and a diagrammatic representation of application proxy architecture, see [Using Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md).\\\\n+Private network connectors are lightweight agents you install on a Windows Server inside your network. They create outbound connections to Microsoft Entra Private Access and the application proxy service to reach backend resources. Organize connectors into connector groups that handle traffic for specific resources. For an architecture overview, see [Using Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md). To set them up, see [How to configure private network connectors for Microsoft Entra Private Access](how-to-configure-connectors.md). Users connect to the cloud service, which routes traffic to apps through the connectors.\\\\n \\\\n+Set up and register a connector with the application proxy service:\\\\n+1. Open outbound ports 80 and 443 and allow access to the required service and Microsoft Entra ID URLs.\\\\n+1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center and run the installer on an on-premises Windows Server.\\\\n+1. Start the connector so it listens to the application proxy service.\\\\n+1. Add the on-premises application to Microsoft Entra ID and set the user-facing URLs.\\\\n \\\\n-To learn how to configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector, see [How to configure private network connectors for Microsoft Entra Private Access](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Private network connectors are lightweight agents deployed on-premises that facilitate the outbound connection to the application proxy service in the cloud. The connectors must be installed on a Windows Server that has access to the backend application. Users connect to the application proxy cloud service that routes their traffic to the apps via the connectors.\\\\n-\\\\n-Setup and registration between a connector and the application proxy service is accomplished as follows:\\\\n-\\\\n-1. The IT administrator opens ports 80 and 443 to outbound traffic and allows access to several URLs that are needed by the connector, the application proxy service, and Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n-2. The admin signs into the Microsoft Entra admin center and runs an executable to install the connector on an on-premises Windows server.\\\\n-3. The connector starts to \\\\\\\"listen\\\\\\\" to the application proxy service.\\\\n-4. The admin adds the on-premises application to Microsoft Entra ID and configures settings such as the URLs users need to connect to their apps.\\\\n-\\\\n-It's recommended that you always deploy multiple connectors for redundancy and scale. The connectors, in conjunction with the service, take care of all the high availability tasks and can be added or removed dynamically. Each time a new request arrives it's routed to one of the connectors that is available. When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. If a connector is temporarily unavailable, it doesn't respond to this traffic. Unused connectors are tagged as inactive and removed after 10 days of inactivity.\\\\n+Deploy at least two connectors for redundancy and scale. The service and connectors handle high availability, and you can add or remove connectors at any time. Each request routes to an available connector. If a connector is unavailable, it doesn't handle traffic. The service tags unused connectors as inactive and removes them after 10 days of inactivity.\\\\n \\\\n > [!NOTE]\\\\n > You can monitor the [version history page](reference-version-history.md) to stay informed on the latest updates so that you can schedule appropriate connector upgrades.\\\\n \\\\n-Each private network connector is assigned to a [connector group](concept-connector-groups.md). Connectors in the same connector group act as a single unit for high availability and load balancing. You can create new groups, assign connectors to them in the Microsoft Entra admin center, then assign specific connectors to serve specific applications.

If one is found, the connectors update themselves.\\\\n+Connectors poll the service for updates. When a newer version is available, they update themselves.\\\\n \\\\n-You can monitor your connectors from the machine they're running on, using either the event log and performance counters. You can also view their status in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For Microsoft Entra Private Access, navigate to Global Secure Access, Connect, and select Connectors. For application proxy, navigate to Identity, Applications, Enterprise applications, and select the application. On the application page select application proxy.\\\\n+Monitor connectors on the host machine by using the event log and performance counters. View status in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. Unused connectors are tagged as `_inactive_` and are removed after 10 days of inactivity. If you do want to uninstall a connector, though, uninstall both the Connector service and the Updater service from the server. Restart the computer to fully remove the service.\\\\n+You don't need to delete unused connectors manually. The service tags inactive connectors `_inactive_` and removes them after 10 days.

If your CPU or memory utilization is above the suggested maximum, you may want to consider adding more connectors to distribute your workloads effectively. \\\\n+Keep peak CPU and memory utilization per connector under 70%. If sustained utilization exceeds 70%, add connectors to the group or scale up host capacity to distribute load. Monitor with Windows performance counters to validate that utilization returns to an acceptable range.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Throughput:** \\\\n-Each connector, configured with the above specifications, can support up to 1.5 Gbps throughput over TCP on an Azure VM. Throughput is measured as the total of both inbound and outbound traffic. Higher throughput can be achieved by running the connector on VMs with increased memory, CPU resources, and enhanced network link speeds.\\\\n+Up to ~1.5 Gbps aggregate TCP throughput (combined inbound + outbound) per connector on an Azure VM sized at 4 vCPU / 8 GiB RAM with standard networking. Higher throughput can be achieved by using larger VM sizes (more vCPUs, memory, accelerated/high-bandwidth NICs) or by adding more connectors in the same group to scale out.\\\\n \\\\n-**Additional Details:**  \\\\n-- Sizing recommendations made above are based on performance testing done on a test tenant using iPerf3 tool with TCP data streams. Actual performance can vary under different testing environments. More details on specific test cases will be published as part of this documentation in coming months. \\\\n+**More details:**  \\\\n+- Performance guidance (for example ~1.5 Gbps on a 4 vCPU / 8 GiB host) is derived from controlled lab tests using iPerf3 TCP data streams in a dedicated test tenant. Actual throughput can vary based on CPU generation, NIC capabilities (accelerated networking, offloads), TLS cipher suites, network latency and jitter, packet loss, concurrent protocol mix (HTTP(S), SMB, RDP), intermediate devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS, SSL inspection), and backend application responsiveness. Scenario-based benchmark data (mixed workloads, high-connection concurrency, latency-sensitive applications) will be added to this documentation as it becomes available.\\\\n - Once a connector is enrolled, it establishes outbound TLS tunnels to the Private Access cloud infrastructure. These tunnels handle all data path traffic. In addition, we have some control plane channel, driving keep-alive heartbeat, health reporting, connector upgrades and so on utilizing minimal bandwidth.\\\\n-- You can deploy additional connectors within the same connector group to increase overall throughput, provided adequate network and internet connectivity is available.

You want to keep as much traffic within a specific datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. You deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the applications that reside within the datacenter. This approach minimizes cross-datacenter links and provides an entirely transparent experience to your users.\\\\n+Large organizations use multiple datacenters. Keep as much traffic in a datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. Deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the apps in that datacenter. This approach reduces cross-datacenter traffic and is transparent to users.\\\\n \\\\n ### Applications installed on isolated networks\\\\n \\\\n-Applications can be hosted in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. You can use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks to also isolate applications to the network. The scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific application.\\\\n+Apps run in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. Use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks and keep those apps contained there. This scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific app.\\\\n \\\\n-### Applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\\\n+### Applications installed on infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\\\\n \\\\n-For applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud access, connector groups provide a common service to secure access to all apps. Connector groups don't create more dependencies on your corporate network, or fragment the app experience. Connectors are installed on every cloud datacenter and serve only applications that reside in that network. You install several connectors to achieve high availability.\\\\n+For apps on infrastructure as a service (IaaS), use connector groups to secure access to all apps without adding corporate network dependencies or fragmenting the experience. Install connectors in each cloud datacenter and scope them to apps in that network. Install multiple connectors for high availability.\\\\n \\\\n-Take as an example an organization that has several virtual machines connected to their own IaaS hosted virtual network. To allow employees to use these applications, these private networks are connected to the corporate network using site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Site-to-site VPN provides a good experience for employees that are located on-premises. But, it isn't ideal for remote employees, because it requires more on-premises infrastructure to route access, as illustrated in the diagram:\\\\n+For example, an organization has several virtual machines connected to its own IaaS-hosted virtual network.

The connector’s machines are joined to a domain that can delegate the users to the application. KCD supports cross-forest capabilities. But for companies who have distinct multi-forest environments with no trust between them, a single connector can't be used for all forests. Instead, specific connectors are deployed per forest, and set to serve applications that are published to serve only the users of that specific forest. Each connector group represents a different forest. While the tenant and most of the experience is unified for all forests, users can be assigned to their forest applications using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n+Single sign-on often uses Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).

Deploy dedicated connectors per forest and scope them to apps for users in that forest. Each connector group represents a forest. The tenant and most of the experience are unified, and you assign users to their forest apps by using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n \\\\n-### Disaster Recovery sites\\\\n+### Disaster recovery sites\\\\n \\\\n There are two approaches to consider for disaster recovery (DR) sites:\\\\n \\\\n-* Your DR site is built in active-active mode where it's exactly like the main site. The site also has the same networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. You can create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers for you.\\\\n-* Your DR site is separate from the main site. You create a different connector group in the DR site. You either have backup applications, or manually divert existing application to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n+* Your DR site runs in active-active mode and matches the main site networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. Create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers.\\\\n+* Your DR site is separate from the main site. Create a different connector group there. Use backup apps or manually divert existing apps to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n \\\\n ### Serve multiple companies from a single tenant\\\\n \\\\n-You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies. Connector groups help you segregate the connectors and applications into different groups. One way, which is suitable for small companies, is to have a single Microsoft Entra tenant while the different companies have their own domain name and networks. The same approach works for merger scenarios and situations where a single division serves several companies for regulatory or business reasons.\\\\n+You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies.

All applications are served using customized connector groups.\\\\n+For large, complex organizations, set the default connector group to hold idle or newly installed connectors. Don’t assign applications to it.

These versions contain a back-end service change that hardens our services and readies Connect Sync for the [MSOnline PowerShell retirement](https://aka.ms/msonlineretirement) in April 2025. **All customers are required to upgrade** to the [minimum versions](#minimum-versions) by **April 30, 2025**.\\\\n \\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n->**All customers are required to upgrade** to the [minimum versions](#minimum-versions) by **April 30, 2025**.\\\\n+#customer intent: As an IT admin, I want to know the minimum version requirements for Microsoft Entra Connect Sync so that I can ensure compliance.\\\\n+---\\\\n+# Hardening update to Microsoft Entra Connect Sync\\\\n \\\\n-The deadline has been extended by three weeks from the earlier communicated date of April 7, 2025.\\\\n+As part of increasing the security posture of Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft deployed a dedicated first-party application to enable the synchronization between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. This new application will manifest as a first party service principal called the \\\\\\\"Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service\\\\\\\" (Application Id: `6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016`) and will be visible in the Enterprise Applications experience within the Microsoft Entra admin center. This application is critical for the continued operation of on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID synchronization functionality through Entra Connect.\\\\n \\\\n+We have since released a new version (2.5.79.0) of Microsoft Entra Connect that contains this service change.  All customers are required to upgrade to the minimum versions by September 30, 2026 to avoid service disruptions.\\\\n \\\\n ## Expected impacts \\\\n \\\\n-Though the deadline has been extended, if you are not yet on a minimum supported version, you'll experience the following impacts after the original date:\\\\n-\\\\n-- After April 7, 2025, configuration of Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) scenarios through Microsoft Entra Connect wizard won't work.\\\\n- - After April 7, 2025, configuration of PingFederate scenarios through the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard won't work.\\\\n- - After April 30, 2025, all authentication requests to Microsoft Entra ID on the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard will fail. Some of the capabilities that will be impacted include schema refresh, configuration of staging mode and user sign-in changes.\\\\n-\\\\n-For example, when calling the MSOnline PowerShell cmdlet `Get-MsolUserRole`, Microsoft Entra Connect wizard throws an error: _\\\\\\\"Access Denied. You do not have permissions to call this cmdlet\\\\\\\"_\\\\n-\\\\n-![Screenshot that shows MSOnline PowerShell error in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync wizard.](media/harden-update-ad-fs-pingfederate/msonline-connect-wizard-error.png)\\\\n-\\\\n+If you aren’t upgraded to the minimum required version (2.5.79.0), you might encounter the following impact to the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync service when the service change takes effect:\\\\n \\\\n-## What won't be impacted\\\\n-\\\\n-- Your sync service will run as usual, and changes will continue to sync to Microsoft Entra.\\\\n- - The ability to upgrade your Microsoft Entra Connect Sync instance. You can still perform the upgrade after April 30, 2025.\\\\n-   \\\\n->[!NOTE]\\\\n->If you're unable to upgrade by the deadline, you can still restore the impacted functionalities by upgrading to the [latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594). You will, however, lose the ability to **make changes on the Entra Connect Sync wizard that require user sign in with the Entra ID credentials** during the time period between **April 30, 2025 and when you upgrade**.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Minimum versions \\\\n-\\\\n-To avoid service impacts, customers should be on version by April 30, 2025. \\\\n-- Customers in commercial clouds: [2.4.18.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#24180) or any newer version (see [version history](reference-connect-version-history.md)\\\\\\\\)\\\\n-- Customers in noncommercial clouds: [2.4.21.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#24210) or any newer version (see [version history](reference-connect-version-history.md))\\\\n-\\\\n-To upgrade to the latest version.\\\\n-> [!div class=\\\\\\\"nextstepaction\\\\\\\"]\\\\n-> [Install the latest Microsoft Entra Connect Sync](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594)\\\\n-\\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> Make sure you familiarize yourself with the [minimum requirements](how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md) for the versions, including but not limited to: \\\\n->  - [.NET 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472#:~:text=Downloads%20for%20building%20and%20running%20applications%20with%20.NET%20Framework%204.7.2)\\\\n-\\\\n-To assist customers with the upgrade process, we perform autoupgrades for select releases, which can help streamline the upgrade process for you. If you would like to be autoupgraded, ensure you have the [autoupgrade feature](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md) configured. For [autoupgrade to work](security-updates-pks.md), ensure that you meet the [minimum requirements](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md#auto-upgrade-eligibility) for autoupgrade. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Workaround for enabling Staging mode post MSOnline retirement\\\\n-\\\\n-Post the MSOnline retirement date, older versions of Microsoft Entra Connect can’t switch Staging mode via the wizard.\\\\n-\\\\n-You can safely proceed with the in-place upgrade to fully restore Microsoft Entra Connect functionally, but in case you want to enable Staging mode prior to upgrade your server, the following workaround via PowerShell is available.\\\\n+All synchronization services in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync will fail.\\\\n \\\\n > [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The following cmdlet is not supported in PowerShell 7 and only works on older Microsoft Entra Connect versions that have MSOnline module dependencies.\\\\n+> If you’re unable to upgrade by the deadline, you can restore the impacted functionalities by upgrading to the latest version.

Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is the new sync client that works from the cloud and allows customers to set up and manage their sync preferences online. We recommend that you use Cloud Sync because we're introducing new features that improve the sync experiences through Cloud Sync. You can avoid future migrations by choosing Cloud Sync if that's the right option for you. Use the https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions to see if Cloud Sync is the right sync client for you. \\\\n \\\\n-See the video below to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.\\\\n+See the following video to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.\\\\n \\\\n > [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/9T6lKEloq0Q]\\\\n \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"42407c4d30124f95d445e8d9277ebcef08150eed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 6,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 7,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md?ref=3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -8,13 +8,18 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.tgt_pltfrm: na\\\\n ms.custom: no-azure-ad-ps-ref, sfi-ga-nochange\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 08/28/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 09/17/2025\\\\n ms.subservice: hybrid-connect\\\\n ms.author: jomondi\\\\n ---\\\\n # Prerequisites for Microsoft Entra Connect\\\\n This article describes the prerequisites and the hardware requirements for Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n \\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+>**Mandatory Upgrade Required**: All synchronization services in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync will stop working on **September 30, 2026** if you're not on at least version 2.5.79.0.

You want to keep as much traffic within a specific datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. You deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the applications that reside within the datacenter. This approach minimizes cross-datacenter links and provides an entirely transparent experience to your users.\\\\n+Large organizations use multiple datacenters. Keep as much traffic in a datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. Deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the apps in that datacenter. This approach reduces cross-datacenter traffic and is transparent to users.\\\\n \\\\n ### Applications installed on isolated networks\\\\n \\\\n-Applications can be hosted in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. You can use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks to also isolate applications to the network. The scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific application.\\\\n+Apps run in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. Use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks and keep those apps contained there. This scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific app.\\\\n \\\\n-### Applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\\\n+### Applications installed on infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\\\\n \\\\n-For applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud access, connector groups provide a common service to secure access to all apps. Connector groups don't create more dependencies on your corporate network, or fragment the app experience. Connectors are installed on every cloud datacenter and serve only applications that reside in that network. You install several connectors to achieve high availability.\\\\n+For apps on infrastructure as a service (IaaS), use connector groups to secure access to all apps without adding corporate network dependencies or fragmenting the experience. Install connectors in each cloud datacenter and scope them to apps in that network. Install multiple connectors for high availability.\\\\n \\\\n-Take as an example an organization that has several virtual machines connected to their own IaaS hosted virtual network. To allow employees to use these applications, these private networks are connected to the corporate network using site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Site-to-site VPN provides a good experience for employees that are located on-premises. But, it isn't ideal for remote employees, because it requires more on-premises infrastructure to route access, as illustrated in the diagram:\\\\n+For example, an organization has several virtual machines connected to its own IaaS-hosted virtual network.

The connector’s machines are joined to a domain that can delegate the users to the application. KCD supports cross-forest capabilities. But for companies who have distinct multi-forest environments with no trust between them, a single connector can't be used for all forests. Instead, specific connectors are deployed per forest, and set to serve applications that are published to serve only the users of that specific forest. Each connector group represents a different forest. While the tenant and most of the experience is unified for all forests, users can be assigned to their forest applications using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n+Single sign-on often uses Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).

Deploy dedicated connectors per forest and scope them to apps for users in that forest. Each connector group represents a forest. The tenant and most of the experience are unified, and you assign users to their forest apps by using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n \\\\n-### Disaster Recovery sites\\\\n+### Disaster recovery sites\\\\n \\\\n There are two approaches to consider for disaster recovery (DR) sites:\\\\n \\\\n-* Your DR site is built in active-active mode where it's exactly like the main site. The site also has the same networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. You can create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers for you.\\\\n-* Your DR site is separate from the main site. You create a different connector group in the DR site. You either have backup applications, or manually divert existing application to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n+* Your DR site runs in active-active mode and matches the main site networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. Create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers.\\\\n+* Your DR site is separate from the main site. Create a different connector group there. Use backup apps or manually divert existing apps to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n \\\\n ### Serve multiple companies from a single tenant\\\\n \\\\n-You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies. Connector groups help you segregate the connectors and applications into different groups. One way, which is suitable for small companies, is to have a single Microsoft Entra tenant while the different companies have their own domain name and networks. The same approach works for merger scenarios and situations where a single division serves several companies for regulatory or business reasons.\\\\n+You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies.

Don’t assign applications to it.

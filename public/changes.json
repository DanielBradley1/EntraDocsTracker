To resolve this issue, append the following feature flags to the Microsoft Entra admin center URL: `?feature.msaljs=true&exp.msaljsexp=true`. If you're accessing the admin center for a partner tenant (e.g., Fabrikam) and encounter the error at `https://entra.microsoft.com/`, update the URL as follows: `https://entra.microsoft.com/?feature.msaljs=true&exp.msaljsexp=true#home`.

        "Response": "The changes include updates to documentation regarding tenant restrictions, specifically addressing limitations with macOS Platform SSO and issues accessing the Microsoft Entra admin center. Additionally, documentation has been enhanced to include Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access scenarios within the Security Copilot documentation, detailing how to investigate network traffic logs. Furthermore, adjustments have been made to clarify advanced options for passkeys (FIDO2) and certificate-based authentication in Conditional Access policies, including updated terminology and troubleshooting guidance. Finally, improvements have been made to the documentation on analyzing Conditional Access policy impact, emphasizing the use of report-only mode, Azure Monitor, and insights workbooks.",

        "Response": "This commit introduces a comprehensive restructuring of the Microsoft Entra security documentation. The core `configure-security.md` file has been significantly revised, moving from a pillar-based approach to a more organised grouping of security recommendations. This change is accompanied by the creation of six new markdown files, each dedicated to a specific Zero Trust security pillar (Protect identities and secrets, Protect tenants and isolate production systems, Protect networks, Protect engineering systems, Monitor and detect cyberthreats, and Accelerate response and remediation), providing detailed guidance within each area. Additionally, the table of contents for the fundamentals section has been updated to reflect these changes, and a redirection has been added for the 'What If' tool documentation. Some minor updates have also been made to the Conditional Access documentation, including date changes and clarifying wording.",

CLI\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [introduction-section](./includes/assign-app-role-to-managed-identity-intro.md)]\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [Managed identity for Azure resources overview](./overview.md). \\\\n+- Review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](/azure/logic-apps/authenticate-with-managed-identity).\\\\n+- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Assign a managed identity access to another application's app role using CLI\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/../docs/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Enable managed identity on an Azure resource, [such as an Azure virtual machines](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Find the object ID of the managed identity's service principal.\\\\n+\\\\n+   - **For a system-assigned managed identity**, you can find the object ID on the Azure portal on the resource's **Identity** page. You can also use the following script to find the object ID. You'll need the resource ID of the resource you created in the previous step, which is available in the Azure portal on the resource's **Properties** page.\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        resourceIdWithManagedIdentity=\\\\\\\"/subscriptions/{my subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{my resource group name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{my virtual machine name}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        \\\\n+        oidForMI=$(az resource show --ids $resourceIdWithManagedIdentity --query \\\\\\\"identity.principalId\\\\\\\" -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for managed identity is: $oidForMI\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+    - **For a user-assigned managed identity**, you can find the managed identity's object ID on the Azure portal on the resource's **Overview** page. You can also use the following script to find the object ID. You'll need the resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity.\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        userManagedIdentityResourceId=\\\\\\\"/subscriptions/{my subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{my resource group name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{my managed identity name}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        \\\\n+        oidForMI=$(az resource show --id $userManagedIdentityResourceId --query \\\\\\\"properties.principalId\\\\\\\" -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for managed identity is: $oidForMI\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. [Create a new application registration](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) to represent the service that your managed identity sends a request to.\\\\n+   -  If the API or service that exposes the app role grant to the managed identity already has a service principal in your Microsoft Entra tenant, skip this step.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Find the object ID of the service application's service principal. You can find this using the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/). \\\\n+   1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/). \\\\n+   1. In the left nav blade, select **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**. Then find the application and look for the **Object ID**.  \\\\n+   1. You can also find the service principal's object ID by its display name using the following script:\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        appName=\\\\\\\"{name for your application}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        serverSPOID=$(az ad sp list --filter \\\\\\\"displayName eq '$appName'\\\\\\\" --query '[0].id' -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for server service principal is: $serverSPOID\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+        > [!NOTE]\\\\n+        > Display names for applications are not unique, so you should verify that you obtain the correct application's service principal.\\\\n+\\\\n+    1. Or you can find the Object ID by the unique Application ID for your application registration:\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        appID=\\\\\\\"{application id for your application}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        serverSPOID=$(az ad sp list --filter \\\\\\\"appId eq '$appID'\\\\\\\" --query '[0].id' -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for server service principal is: $serverSPOID\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Add an [app role](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md) to the application you created in the previous step. You can create the role using the Azure portal or using Microsoft Graph. For example, you could add an app role like this:\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```json\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"allowedMemberTypes\\\\\\\": [\\\\n+            \\\\\\\"Application\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ],\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"displayName\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Read data from MyApi\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"isEnabled\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Allow the application to read data as itself.\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"MyApi.Read.All\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Assign the app role to the managed identity.

You can use them to get a Microsoft Entra token for your applications. The applications can use the token when accessing resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Azure manages the identity so you don't have to.\\\\n-\\\\n-There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned. System-assigned managed identities have their lifecycle tied to the resource that created them. This identity is restricted to only one resource, and you can grant permissions to the managed identity by using Azure role-based access control (RBAC). User-assigned managed identities can be used on multiple resources.\\\\n-\\\\n-::: zone pivot=\\\\\\\"identity-mi-methods-azp\\\\\\\"\\\\n-\\\\n-In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using the Azure portal.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md).

Key changes include:\n\n*   **Date updates:** A minor update to the publication date of the \"Deployment external operations\" article.\n*   **Role permission clarification:** The documentation for the \"Conditional Access Optimization Agent\" has been clarified to specify the necessary administrator roles (Global Administrator and Conditional Access Administrator AND Global Reader) for identifying Intune app protection policies.\n*   **Tooling documentation enhancements:** The `Remove-ADSyncToolsAadObject` and `Remove-ADSyncToolsAadPublicFolders` cmdlets documentation has been updated with important notes. These include warnings about the irreversibility of deletions for non-user objects, the requirement for Global Administrator credentials (without MFA support), and the temporary re-enabling of DirSync if it's disabled on the tenant.",

        "Response": "This commit introduces two new PowerShell scripts to the Microsoft Entra documentation for Global Secure Access. These scripts demonstrate how to automate the creation and signing of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for testing purposes, one using Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and the other using OpenSSL. Additionally, the table of contents for Global Secure Access has been updated to include links to these new scripts, and a clarification has been made to the documentation regarding the matching of redirect URIs in the identity platform section, specifically addressing the handling of port numbers for localhost URIs.",

For example, you might be working with another organization and have one point of contact with that organization, but over time more users from that organization will also need access.\\\\n \\\\n With entitlement management, you can define a policy that allows users from organizations you specify to be able to self-request an access package. That policy includes whether approval is required, whether access reviews are required, and an expiration date for the access. In most cases, you want to require approval, in order to have appropriate oversight over which users are brought into your directory. If approval is required, then for major external organization partners, you might consider inviting one or more users from the external organization to your directory, designating them as sponsors, and configuring that sponsors are approvers - since they're likely to know which external users from their organization need access. Once you've configured the access package, obtain the access package's request link so you can send that link to your contact person (sponsor) at the external organization. That contact can share with other users in their external organization, and they can use this link to request the access package. Users from that organization who are already invited into your directory can also use that link.\\\\n \\\\n@@ -99,7 +99,7 @@ To ensure people outside of your organization can request access packages and ge\\\\n \\\\n - Make sure to exclude the Entitlement Management app from any Conditional Access policies that impact guest users.

        "Response": "Several documentation pages have been updated. The 'Global Secure Access Client for iOS' guide has had its 'ms.date' updated and a section on supported traffic forwarding profiles removed. The 'Current Known Limitations' for Global Secure Access has been expanded with additional limitations for iOS, and the 'ms.date' has been updated.\n\nMultiple quickstart guides for native authentication in Microsoft Entra ID (for Android, iOS, macOS, and React SPAs) have been revised to streamline prerequisite steps, particularly around creating and registering applications and user flows within external tenants, and the 'ms.date' has been updated where applicable. The 'Native Authentication API Reference' document has also seen minor updates to prerequisites and links, with a date change. Finally, the 'Entitlement Management External Users' guide has undergone significant revisions, including updating the 'ms.date', clarifying wording around external users and their lifecycle management, and adjusting navigation paths for settings.",

managed-identities\\\\n+ms.topic: how-to\\\\n+ms.date: 09/09/2025\\\\n+ms.author: shermanouko\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Assign an application role to a managed identity using Azure CLI\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [introduction-section](./includes/assign-app-role-to-managed-identity-intro.md)]\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [Managed identity for Azure resources overview](./overview.md). \\\\n+- Review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](/azure/logic-apps/authenticate-with-managed-identity).\\\\n+- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Assign a managed identity access to another application's app role using CLI\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/../docs/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Enable managed identity on an Azure resource, [such as an Azure virtual machines](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Find the object ID of the managed identity's service principal.\\\\n+\\\\n+   - **For a system-assigned managed identity**, you can find the object ID on the Azure portal on the resource's **Identity** page. You can also use the following script to find the object ID. You'll need the resource ID of the resource you created in the previous step, which is available in the Azure portal on the resource's **Properties** page.\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        resourceIdWithManagedIdentity=\\\\\\\"/subscriptions/{my subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{my resource group name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{my virtual machine name}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        \\\\n+        oidForMI=$(az resource show --ids $resourceIdWithManagedIdentity --query \\\\\\\"identity.principalId\\\\\\\" -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for managed identity is: $oidForMI\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+    - **For a user-assigned managed identity**, you can find the managed identity's object ID on the Azure portal on the resource's **Overview** page. You can also use the following script to find the object ID. You'll need the resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity.\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        userManagedIdentityResourceId=\\\\\\\"/subscriptions/{my subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{my resource group name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{my managed identity name}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        \\\\n+        oidForMI=$(az resource show --id $userManagedIdentityResourceId --query \\\\\\\"properties.principalId\\\\\\\" -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for managed identity is: $oidForMI\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. [Create a new application registration](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) to represent the service that your managed identity sends a request to.\\\\n+   -  If the API or service that exposes the app role grant to the managed identity already has a service principal in your Microsoft Entra tenant, skip this step.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Find the object ID of the service application's service principal. You can find this using the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/). \\\\n+   1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/). \\\\n+   1. In the left nav blade, select **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**. Then find the application and look for the **Object ID**.  \\\\n+   1. You can also find the service principal's object ID by its display name using the following script:\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        appName=\\\\\\\"{name for your application}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        serverSPOID=$(az ad sp list --filter \\\\\\\"displayName eq '$appName'\\\\\\\" --query '[0].id' -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for server service principal is: $serverSPOID\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+        > [!NOTE]\\\\n+        > Display names for applications are not unique, so you should verify that you obtain the correct application's service principal.\\\\n+\\\\n+    1. Or you can find the Object ID by the unique Application ID for your application registration:\\\\n+\\\\n+        ```azurecli\\\\n+        appID=\\\\\\\"{application id for your application}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        serverSPOID=$(az ad sp list --filter \\\\\\\"appId eq '$appID'\\\\\\\" --query '[0].id' -o tsv | tr -d '[:space:]')\\\\n+        echo \\\\\\\"object id for server service principal is: $serverSPOID\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Add an [app role](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md) to the application you created in the previous step. You can create the role using the Azure portal or using Microsoft Graph. For example, you could add an app role like this:\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```json\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"allowedMemberTypes\\\\\\\": [\\\\n+            \\\\\\\"Application\\\\\\\"\\\\n+        ],\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"displayName\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Read data from MyApi\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"isEnabled\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Allow the application to read data as itself.\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"MyApi.Read.All\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Assign the app role to the managed identity.

You can use them to get a Microsoft Entra token for your applications. The applications can use the token when accessing resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Azure manages the identity so you don't have to.\\\\n-\\\\n-There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned. System-assigned managed identities have their lifecycle tied to the resource that created them. This identity is restricted to only one resource, and you can grant permissions to the managed identity by using Azure role-based access control (RBAC). User-assigned managed identities can be used on multiple resources.\\\\n-\\\\n-::: zone pivot=\\\\\\\"identity-mi-methods-azp\\\\\\\"\\\\n-\\\\n-In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using the Azure portal.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md).

Key changes include:\n\n*   **Date updates:** A minor update to the publication date of the \"Deployment external operations\" article.\n*   **Role permission clarification:** The documentation for the \"Conditional Access Optimization Agent\" has been clarified to specify the necessary administrator roles (Global Administrator and Conditional Access Administrator AND Global Reader) for identifying Intune app protection policies.\n*   **Tooling documentation enhancements:** The `Remove-ADSyncToolsAadObject` and `Remove-ADSyncToolsAadPublicFolders` cmdlets documentation has been updated with important notes. These include warnings about the irreversibility of deletions for non-user objects, the requirement for Global Administrator credentials (without MFA support), and the temporary re-enabling of DirSync if it's disabled on the tenant.",

        "Response": "This commit introduces two new PowerShell scripts to the Microsoft Entra documentation for Global Secure Access. These scripts demonstrate how to automate the creation and signing of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for testing purposes, one using Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and the other using OpenSSL. Additionally, the table of contents for Global Secure Access has been updated to include links to these new scripts, and a clarification has been made to the documentation regarding the matching of redirect URIs in the identity platform section, specifically addressing the handling of port numbers for localhost URIs.",

For example, you might be working with another organization and have one point of contact with that organization, but over time more users from that organization will also need access.\\\\n \\\\n With entitlement management, you can define a policy that allows users from organizations you specify to be able to self-request an access package. That policy includes whether approval is required, whether access reviews are required, and an expiration date for the access. In most cases, you want to require approval, in order to have appropriate oversight over which users are brought into your directory. If approval is required, then for major external organization partners, you might consider inviting one or more users from the external organization to your directory, designating them as sponsors, and configuring that sponsors are approvers - since they're likely to know which external users from their organization need access. Once you've configured the access package, obtain the access package's request link so you can send that link to your contact person (sponsor) at the external organization. That contact can share with other users in their external organization, and they can use this link to request the access package. Users from that organization who are already invited into your directory can also use that link.\\\\n \\\\n@@ -99,7 +99,7 @@ To ensure people outside of your organization can request access packages and ge\\\\n \\\\n - Make sure to exclude the Entitlement Management app from any Conditional Access policies that impact guest users.

        "Response": "Several documentation pages have been updated. The 'Global Secure Access Client for iOS' guide has had its 'ms.date' updated and a section on supported traffic forwarding profiles removed. The 'Current Known Limitations' for Global Secure Access has been expanded with additional limitations for iOS, and the 'ms.date' has been updated.\n\nMultiple quickstart guides for native authentication in Microsoft Entra ID (for Android, iOS, macOS, and React SPAs) have been revised to streamline prerequisite steps, particularly around creating and registering applications and user flows within external tenants, and the 'ms.date' has been updated where applicable. The 'Native Authentication API Reference' document has also seen minor updates to prerequisites and links, with a date change. Finally, the 'Entitlement Management External Users' guide has undergone significant revisions, including updating the 'ms.date', clarifying wording around external users and their lifecycle management, and adjusting navigation paths for settings.",

This example grants an app an exception to the restriction blocking custom identifier URIs, so it can still have custom URIs added to it. A similar process can be followed for other restrictions.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [Microsoft Entra admin center](#tab/portal)\\\\n+\\\\n+To grant an app an exception to the restriction blocking custom identifier URIs using the Microsoft Entra admin center:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **App management policies**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Block custom identifier URIs**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Ensure the status is **On**. Set the 'Applies to' field to **All applications with exclusions**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Excluded apps**, select **Add applications**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Choose the application you'd like to exclude from the restriction.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Save** to save your settings.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/configure-app-management-policies/identifier-uri-restriction-with-exemption.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the 'custom identifier URI' restriction.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [Microsoft Graph](#tab/graph)\\\\n+\\\\n+To grant an app an exception to the restriction blocking custom identifier URIs using the Microsoft Graph:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Create a new custom app management policy. When creating it, set the `nonDefaultUriAddition` restriction under `restrictions.applicationRestrictions` to `disabled`. \\\\n+\\\\n+    ```http\\\\n+    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/appManagementPolicies\\\\n+\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"restrictions\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+            \\\\\\\"applicationRestrictions\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+                \\\\\\\"identifierUris\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+                    \\\\\\\"nonDefaultUriAddition\\\\\\\": {\\\\n+                        \\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"disabled\\\\\\\"\\\\n+                    }\\\\n+                }\\\\n+            }\\\\n+        }\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Record the ID of the new policy from the response. \\\\n+\\\\n+1. Assign the new custom policy to the application you'd like to exempt.\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```http\\\\n+    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/{objectIdOfTheApplication}/appManagementPolicies/$ref\\\\n+\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"@odata.id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/policies/appManagementPolicies/{idOfTheCustomPolicy}\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. If you get an error indicating that this application already has a custom policy assigned, then instead modify that policy to include this new exclusion. Make sure the existing policy isn't assigned to any other applications, or they'll also receive the exclusion.\\\\n+\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+### Grant an exception to a user or service\\\\n+\\\\n+Sometimes, exceptions need to be granted to the user or service creating or modifying the application. For example, imagine an automated process in your organization periodically creates applications and sets passwords on them. You want to block the new passwords in your organization, but you don't want to break this automated process while you're working on updating it.  [Application exceptions](#grant-an-exception-to-an-application) wouldn't work in this case, because the apps being created/updated don't exist yet! Instead, you can apply an exception to the process itself.  \\\\n+\\\\n+This type of exception - sometimes labeled an 'actor' or 'caller' exception - is configured using [custom security attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-overview). Because of this, you need two additional roles for this scenario, in addition to the roles from [prerequisites](#prerequisites).\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Attribute Definition Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#attribute-definition-administrator)\\\\n+- [Attribute Assignment Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#attribute-assignment-administrator)\\\\n+\\\\n+This example grants a service an exception to the restriction enforcing a max lifetime on new certificates it adds to other applications and service principals. The service will be represented by its service principal. Find the service principal for a service by searching for it in [Enterprise applications](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/~/AppAppsPreview).\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [Microsoft Entra admin center](#tab/portal)\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Under **Excluded callers**, select **Add excluded callers**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Choose the user or service principal whose calls to create/update apps you'd like to exclude from the restriction.\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Custom security attributes are key-value pairs; they require a definition for the key-value pair to be created in the tenant, and then instances of the key-value pair can be added to specific users or service principals.\\\\n+\\\\n+Custom security attribute definitions can be [created through the Microsoft Entra admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-add), but you can also do so using Microsoft Graph.

        "Response": "This commit introduces comprehensive documentation on configuring app management policies within Microsoft Entra ID. The new content, `configure-app-management-policies.md`, details how to set restrictions on application and service principal configurations to enhance security. It covers various restrictions, including those related to key lifetimes, URI additions, and password/symmetric key management, and provides step-by-step guidance for implementation via both the Microsoft Entra admin centre and Microsoft Graph API. Several images have also been added to illustrate the admin centre configuration steps. The `toc.yml` file has been updated to include a link to the new `configure-app-management-policies.md` documentation.",

In this policy, Microsoft Entra Internet Access blocks traffic based on domain and URL indicators from both Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence providers. With the threat intelligence rule engine, you can also configure allow lists for handling false positives. All of these policies can become context-aware with the Security Profile framework, linking Global Secure Access (GSA) security policies to Conditional Access. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Administrators who interact with **Global Secure Access** features must have one or more of the following role assignments depending on the tasks they're performing.\\\\n+   - The [Global Secure Access Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) role to manage the Global Secure Access features.\\\\n+   - The [Conditional Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#conditional-access-administrator) to create and interact with Conditional Access policies.\\\\n+- Complete the [Get started with Global Secure Access](how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access.md) guide.\\\\n+- [Install the Global Secure Access client](how-to-install-windows-client.md) on end user devices.\\\\n+- You must disable Domain Name System (DNS) over HTTPS (Secure DNS) to tunnel network traffic. Use the rules of the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) in the traffic forwarding profile. For more information, see [Configure the DNS client to support DoH](/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support#configure-the-dns-client-to-support-doh).\\\\n+- Disable built-in DNS client on Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\\\\n+- IPv6 traffic isn't acquired by the client and is therefore transferred directly to the network. To enable all relevant traffic to be tunneled, set the network adapter properties to [IPv4 preferred](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check.md#ipv4-preferred).\\\\n+- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic (that is, QUIC) isn't supported in the current preview of Internet Access. Most websites support fallback to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) when QUIC can't be established. For an improved user experience, you can deploy a Windows Firewall rule that blocks outbound UDP 443: \\\\n+\\\\n+```powershell \\\\n+@New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Block QUIC\\\\\\\" -Direction Outbound -Action Block -Protocol UDP  -RemotePort 443\\\\n+``` \\\\n+\\\\n+- (Optional) [Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection](how-to-transport-layer-security.md) in order for URL indicators to be evaluated against HTTPS traffic.\\\\n+\\\\n+## High level steps\\\\n+\\\\n+There are several steps to configuring threat intelligence. Take note of where you need to configure a Conditional Access policy.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. [Enable internet traffic forwarding.](#enable-internet-traffic-forwarding)\\\\n+1. [Create a threat intelligence policy.](#create-a-threat-intelligence-policy)\\\\n+1. [Configure your allow list (optional).](#configure-your-allow-list-optional)\\\\n+1. [Create a security profile.](#create-a-security-profile-or-configure-the-baseline-profile)\\\\n+1. [Link the security profile to a Conditional Access policy.](#create-and-link-conditional-access-policy)\\\\n+\\\\n+## Enable internet traffic forwarding\\\\n+\\\\n+The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile. To learn more about the profile and how to enable it, see [How to manage the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile](how-to-manage-internet-access-profile.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+You can scope the Internet Access profile to specific users and groups. To learn more about user and group assignment, see [How to assign and manage users and groups with traffic forwarding profiles](how-to-manage-users-groups-assignment.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a threat intelligence policy\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**.\\\\n+1. Select **Create policy**.\\\\n+1. Enter a name and description for the policy and select **Next**.\\\\n+1. The default action for threat intelligence is \\\\\\\"Allow\\\\\\\". This means that if traffic doesn't match a rule in the threat intelligence policy, the policy engine will allow the traffic to go to the next security control.\\\\n+1. Select **Next** and **Review** your new threat intelligence policy.\\\\n+1. Select **Create**\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> This policy is created with a rule blocking access to destinations where high severity threats are detected. Microsoft defines high severity threats as domains or URLs associated with active malware distribution, phishing campaigns, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and other threads, identified by Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence feeds with high confidence.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Configure your allow list (optional)\\\\n+\\\\n+If you're aware of sites that may be business-critical or are labeled as false positives, you can configure rules that allow these sites. Note the security risks involved with this action, as the internet threat landscape is ever-changing.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**, select your chosen threat intelligence policy.\\\\n+1. Select **Rules**.\\\\n+1. Select **Add rule**.\\\\n+1. Enter a name, description, priority, and status for the rule.\\\\n+1. Edit **Destination FQDNs** and select the list of domains for your allow list. You can enter these FQDNs as comma-separated domains.\\\\n+1. Select **Add**. \\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a security profile or configure the baseline profile\\\\n+\\\\n+Security profiles are a grouping of security controls like web content filtering and threat intelligence policies. You can assign, or link, security profiles with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies. One security profile can contain a policy of each type.\\\\n+\\\\n+In this step, you create a security profile to group filtering policies like web content filtering and/or threat intelligence. Then you assign, or link, the security profiles with a Conditional Access policy to make them user or context aware.\\\\n+\\\\n+Since threat intelligence is critical for users' basic security posture, you can alternatively link your threat intelligence policy to the baseline security profile, which applies policy to all users' traffic in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> You can only configure threat intelligence policy per security profile. Rule priorities within each security control handle exceptions, and security controls follow the ordering, (1) TLS inspection > (2) Web content filtering > (3) Threat intelligence > (4) File type > (6) Data loss prevention > (7) Third-party\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Security profiles**.\\\\n+2. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n+3. Enter a name and description for the profile and select **Next**.\\\\n+4. Select **Link a policy** and then select **Existing threat intelligence policy**.\\\\n+5. Select the threat intelligence policy you already created and select **Add**.\\\\n+6. Select **Next** to review the security profile and associated policy.\\\\n+7. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n+8. Select **Refresh** to view the new profile.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create and link Conditional Access policy\\\\n+\\\\n+Create a Conditional Access policy for end users or groups and deliver your security profile through Conditional Access Session controls. Conditional Access is the delivery mechanism for user and context awareness for Internet Access policies.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **Identity** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.\\\\n+2. Select **Create new policy**.\\\\n+3. Enter a name and assign a user or group.\\\\n+4. Select **Target resources** and **All internet resources with Global Secure Access**.\\\\n+5. Select **Session** > **Use Global Secure Access security profile** and choose a security profile.\\\\n+6. Select **Select**.\\\\n+7. In the **Enable policy** section, ensure **On** is selected.\\\\n+8. Select **Create**.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Applying a new security profile can take up to 60-90 minutes because security profiles are enforced via access tokens.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Verify end user policy enforcement\\\\n+\\\\n+Use a Windows device with the Global Secure Access client installed. Sign in as a user that is assigned the Internet traffic acquisition profile. Test that navigating to malicious websites is blocked as expected.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> After configuring a threat intelligence policy, you may need to [clear your browser's cache](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/learning-center/how-to-manage-and-clear-your-cache-and-cookies) to validate policy enforcement.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Right-click on the Global Secure Access client icon in the task manager tray and open **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Forwarding profile**. Ensure that the Internet access acquisition rules are present.\\\\n+1. Navigate to a known malicious site (for example, `entratestthreat.com` or `smartscreentestratings2.net`). Ensure that you're blocked and that the Threat Type field is nonempty in the traffic logs. Traffic logs may take up to 5 minutes to appear in the portal.\\\\n+1. If blocked by Windows Defender or Smart screen, override and access the site to test the Global Secure Access block message. You can do this by choosing \\\\\\\"Continue to the unsafe site (not recommended)\\\\\\\" under \\\\\\\"More information.\\\\\\\"\\\\n+1. To test allow-listing, create a rule in the Threat Intelligence policy to allow access to the site. Within 2 minutes, you should be able to access it. (You may need to clear your browser cache.)\\\\n+1.

It extends traditional Kerberos capabilities into the Microsoft Entra ecosystem, allowing organizations to modernize their identity infrastructure without sacrificing compatibility with legacy systems. It also enables seamless single sign-on (SSO) to on-premises resources for users authenticated with modern credentials like Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys.\\\\n+\\\\n+In practice, Microsoft Entra Kerberos turns Microsoft Entra ID into a cloud-based Key Distribution Center (KDC) for Kerberos authentication. This capability allows Microsoft Entra ID to issue Kerberos tickets for users, extending traditional Kerberos authentication beyond on-premises Active Directory. Microsoft Entra Kerberos was introduced in 2021 to help bridge the gap between legacy, on-premises authentication protocols, and modern cloud identity.\\\\n+\\\\n+In a hybrid scenario, where accounts exist on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and those users are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Kerberos plays a crucial role. It enables these hybrid users to authenticate to cloud and on-premises resources using Kerberos without needing direct line of sight to domain controllers. For example, if a Microsoft Entra ID–joined Windows client accesses a file share or application over the internet, Microsoft Entra ID can issue the necessary Kerberos tickets on behalf of the on-premises Active Directory environment.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> For more information about Kerberos in Windows, see [Kerberos authentication overview](/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Hybrid Identity \\\\n+\\\\n+A hybrid identity refers to a user identity that exists both in an on-premises Active Directory (AD DS) and in Microsoft Entra ID. These identities are synchronized using tools like Microsoft Entra Connect, allowing users to access both cloud-based and on-premises resources with a single set of credentials. This setup enables seamless authentication and single sign-on (SSO) experiences across environments. It is ideal for organizations transitioning to the cloud while maintaining legacy infrastructure. \\\\n+\\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> Currently, Microsoft Entra Kerberos only works with hybrid identities.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Key features and benefits\\\\n+\\\\n+**Seamless Hybrid authentication**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos allows users whose accounts reside in on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate across cloud and on-premises resources. It reduces and in some cases eliminates the need for direct connectivity to domain controllers. For example, when a Microsoft Entra ID-joined Windows client accesses a file share or application over the internet, Entra ID can issue the necessary Kerberos tickets as a KDC associated with the resource.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Enhanced security with modern credentials support**: Users can sign in using passwordless methods such as Windows Hello for Business or FIDO2 security keys yet still access on-premises resources protected by Kerberos. Enables multifactor and password-less authentication, reducing risks associated with password theft and phishing attacks.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Simplified Hybrid join**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos supports hybrid join scenarios without requiring ADFS or Microsoft Entra Connect sync. This is ideal for non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), disconnected forests, and Azure Virtual Desktop.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Secure ticket exchange**: Microsoft Entra Kerberos uses a secure Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) exchange model.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Scalable group memberships**: Addresses traditional Kerberos limitations with large or dynamic group memberships, improving reliability and user experience. In scenarios involving large groups of users, performance is optimized through automatic load distribution across all domain controllers (DCs) within a site. For deployments in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments, we recommend ensuring that sufficient DCs are available and geographically close to the environment to maintain responsiveness.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## How Microsoft Entra Kerberos works\\\\n+\\\\n+**Microsoft Entra Kerberos** allows your Microsoft Entra ID tenant to operate as a dedicated Kerberos realm alongside your existing on-premises Active Directory realm. When a user signs in to a Windows device that is either Microsoft Entra ID‑joined or hybrid joined, the device authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID and receives a [Primary Refresh Token](../devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+In addition to the PRT, Entra ID can issue a partial Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This TGT enables the user to exchange it for a fully formed on‑premises TGT when needed, and it can also issue a Cloud Ticket Granting Ticket (Cloud TGT) which enables the user to request Kerberos service tickets for accessing cloud‑based resources. In this model, Microsoft Entra ID acts as the Key Distribution Center (KDC), facilitating secure and seamless authentication.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Authentication flow\\\\n+\\\\n+### User authentication:\\\\n+- The user signs into a Windows device (Windows 10 2004+ or Windows 11).\\\\n+- The Local Security Authority (LSA) uses the Cloud Authentication Provider (CloudAP) to authenticate via OAuth to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID issues a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) containing user and device information.\\\\n+- The TGT is for the realm KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM, which acts as a cloud-based Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC).\\\\n+\\\\n+### Cloud TGT issuance:\\\\n+- If the user signs in with a passwordless method (such as FIDO2 or Windows Hello for Business), Microsoft Entra ID issues a Partial Ticket Granting Ticket (Partial TGT) for the user's on-premises Active Directory (AD) domain. This Partial TGT contains the user's Security Identifier (SID) but no authorization data.\\\\n+\\\\n+- A Kerberos server object exists in the on-premises AD, created and synchronized via Microsoft Entra Connect. This object allows Microsoft Entra ID to generate these partial TGTs for use by on-premises domain controllers to facilitate on-premises resource access.\\\\n+\\\\n+- The Partial TGT issued by Entra ID is exchanged with an on-premises Active Directory domain controller to obtain a full TGT that includes group memberships and other access control data. The Partial TGT must be exchanged with a domain controller to gain full authorization information.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID also acts as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for cloud resources, issuing a Cloud Ticket Granting Ticket (Cloud TGT) to the client when appropriate. The Cloud TGT is stored in the client's Kerberos ticket cache, and the client recognizes the Microsoft Entra ID tenant as a separate Kerberos realm for cloud resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Microsoft Entra Kerberos TGT and Active Directory access control\\\\n+Possessing an Microsoft Entra Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for a user's on-premises Active Directory (AD) domain does not automatically grant access to a full AD TGT. To complete the exchange, the user must be listed in the reveal credentials allowlist on the Azure AD Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) object and not in the blocklist. As a best practice, the default configuration should be set to Deny, with explicit Allow permissions granted only to groups authorized to use Microsoft Entra Kerberos.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/kerberos/kerberos-account.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of a user account properties in Active Directory.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/kerberos/kerberos-account.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+    \\\\n+During the exchange process, where a partial Microsoft Entra Kerberos TGT is converted into a full AD TGT these lists are evaluated to determine access eligibility. If a user is blocked or not explicitly allowed, the request is denied and results in an error.\\\\n+\\\\n+    \\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> The TGT is only recognized by on-premises Active Directory. Therefore, having access to a partial TGT doesn't provide access to other resources outside of AD.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Cloud TGT for cloud resources:\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID acts as a Key Distribution Center (KDC under the realm KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM issuing a Cloud Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the client.\\\\n+- The client recognizes the Microsoft Entra ID tenant as a separate Kerberos realm for cloud resources and the TGT is stored in the client's Kerberos ticket cache.\\\\n+- The cloud TGT contains authorization data only specific to cloud services and is sufficient for accessing resources integrated with Microsoft Entra Kerberos, such as Azure Files and Azure SQL.\\\\n+\\\\n+>[!NOTE]\\\\n+> The Cloud TGT isn't a replacement for the on-premises TGT. It's another ticket that allows access to cloud resources. The on-premises TGT is still required for accessing on-premises resources.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Realm mapping and Azure tenant info:\\\\n+- Windows LSASS manages the Kerberos Cloud TGT, realm mapping, and Entra ID tenant information. The Kerberos stack maintains the Cloud TGT and realm mapping, using a KDC Proxy to route Kerberos traffic to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- For Azure Virtual Desktop, the user receives both a PRT and Cloud TGT. Azure Virtual Desktop uses FSLogix to load the user profile from Azure Files.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Service ticket request and issuance:\\\\n+\\\\n+**Access on-premises resources**:\\\\n+- Entra ID issues a partial TGT.\\\\n+- The client contacts an on-premises AD domain controller to exchange it for a full TGT.\\\\n+- This full TGT is then used to access on-premises resources like SMB shares or SQL servers.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Access cloud resources**:\\\\n+The client uses cloud TGT to request service tickets for cloud resources. No interaction with on-premises AD is needed.\\\\n+- When the user accesses a service (for example, Azure Files), the client requests a service ticket from Microsoft Entra ID by presenting the TGT.\\\\n+- The client sends a Ticket Granting Service Request (TGS-REQ) to Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- Kerberos identifies the service (for example, cifs/mystuff.file.core.windows.net) and maps the domain to KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM. The KDC Proxy protocol enables Kerberos communication over the internet.\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra ID verifies the Cloud TGT and the user's identity and looks up the requested Service Principal Name (SPN) for the Azure Files resource registered in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+- Generates a service ticket and encrypts it using the service principal's key and returns the ticket to the client in a TGS-REP.\\\\n+- The Kerberos stack processes the TGS-REP, extracts the ticket, and generates an Application Request (AP-REQ).\\\\n+- The AP-REQ is provided to SMB, which includes it in the request to Azure Files.\\\\n+- Azure Files decrypts the ticket and grants access.

Windows Authentication for managed instances empowers customers to move existing services to the cloud while maintaining a seamless user experience and provides the basis for infrastructure modernization.\\\\n+Detailed information at [Windows Authentication access to Azure SQL Managed Instance using Microsoft Entra Kerberos](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/winauth-azuread-overview) \\\\n+\\\\n+### Use SSO to sign in to on-premises resources by using FIDO2 keys\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Kerberos users can sign in to Windows with modern credentials, such as FIDO2 security keys, and then access traditional Active Directory-based resources.  \\\\n+Detailed information at [Passwordless security key sign-in to on-premises resources](howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key-on-premises.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+### Enable Kerberos SSO to on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID Kerberos resources in platform SSO\\\\n+\\\\n+Along with PSSO PRT, Microsoft Entra also issues both on-premises and cloud-based Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) which are then shared with the native Kerberos stack in macOS via TGT mapping in PSSO.  \\\\n+Detailed information at: [Enable Kerberos SSO to on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID Kerberos Resources in Platform SSO](~/identity/devices/device-join-macos-platform-single-sign-on-kerberos-configuration.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+### Profile containers with FSLogix for Azure Virtual Desktop\\\\n+For hosting user profiles for virtual desktops, customers can store profiles in Azure Files accessed via Microsoft Entra Kerberos.\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Kerberos enables Microsoft Entra ID to issue the necessary Kerberos tickets to access the file share with the industry-standard SMB protocol.\\\\n+Detailed information at: [Store FSLogix profile containers on Azure Files using Microsoft Entra ID in a hybrid scenario - FSLogix](/fslogix/how-to-configure-profile-container-entra-id-hybrid)\\\\n+    \\\\n+### Enable Microsoft Entra Kerberos authentication for hybrid identities on Azure Files\\\\n+Microsoft Entra Kerberos authentication hybrid users to access Azure file shares using Kerberos authentication, using Microsoft Entra ID to issue the necessary Kerberos tickets to access the file share with the SMB protocol.  \\\\n+Detailed information at: [Microsoft Entra Kerberos for hybrid identities on Azure Files](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-hybrid-identities-enable?tabs=azure-portal%2Cintune)\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limitations and considerations\\\\n+\\\\n+### Support limited to Hybrid user identities: \\\\n+- Microsoft Entra Kerberos only supports hybrid user identities created in on-premises AD and synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID via Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n+- Cloud-only user accounts managed solely in Microsoft Entra ID aren't supported for Kerberos authentication.\\\\n+### Operating system and device restrictions\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra Kerberos is supported on Microsoft Entra joined or hybrid joined Windows 10 (2004+) and Windows 11 devices.\\\\n+- Some features depend on specific Windows versions and patches.\\\\n+### Network connectivity requirements for ACL configuration\\\\n+- While users can access Azure file shares over the internet without direct domain controller connectivity, configuring Windows ACLs or file-level permissions requires unimpeded network access to on-premises domain controllers.\\\\n+### No Cross-Tenant or Guest user support\\\\n+- B2B guest users or users from other Microsoft Entra tenants can't currently authenticate using Microsoft Entra Kerberos.\\\\n+### Password expiration\\\\n+- Service principal passwords for storage accounts expire every six months and need to be rotated to maintain access.\\\\n+### Group membership limits\\\\n+- Kerberos tickets have a size constraint that limits the number of group SIDs (Security Identifiers) that can be included. The default cap is 1,010 groups per ticket. If exceeded, only the first 1010 are included, which can cause access failures for users in large organizations.\\\\n+### MFA incompatibility for Azure files authentication\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra Kerberos authentication for Azure file shares doesn't support multifactor authentication (MFA).\\\\n+- Conditional Access policies enforcing MFA must exclude the storage account application or users experience authentication failures.\\\\n+- Exclude Azure Files from Conditional Access policies that require MFA. This can be done by scoping the policy to exclude the storage account or the specific application accessing Azure Files.\\\\n+### Attribute synchronization requirements\\\\n+- Proper synchronization of key on-premises AD user attributes is essential for Microsoft Entra Kerberos to work, including onPremisesDomainName, onPremisesUserPrincipalName, and onPremisesSamAccountName.\\\\n+### Single AD method per Azure Storage account\\\\n+- For Azure Files identity-based authentication, only one AD method (Microsoft Entra Kerberos, on-premises AD DS, or Microsoft Entra Domain Services) can be enabled per storage account at a time.\\\\n+- Switching between methods requires disabling the current method first.\\\\n+### Kerberos encryption settings\\\\n+- Kerberos ticket encryption with Microsoft Entra Kerberos uses AES-256 exclusively. SMB channel encryption can be configured separately based on requirements.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Getting started with Microsoft Entra Kerberos\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Set Up Microsoft Entra Connect**:\\\\n+    - Synchronize on-premises AD DS users to Microsoft Entra ID.

The agent then analyzes identified reviews by gathering extra insights, and generates a recommendation (approve / deny) and a justification summary for each decision. Once the agent analyzes the recommendations and corresponding justification summaries, it's able to guide reviewers, in natural language, through the review process in Microsoft Teams. Reviewers are empowered to complete their reviews through the natural language chat experience in Microsoft Teams. As the agent guides them through the review, they're able to review the agent's reasoning behind the recommendations, ask questions in the context of the review itself, and finally make their own informed decision.\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"e8cf927a702668c2d946edaa2c593759b6be8eff\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/id-governance/media/access-review-agent-logs-metrics/access-agent-review-card-justification.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fmedia%2Faccess-review-agent-logs-metrics%2Faccess-agent-review-card-justification.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fmedia%2Faccess-review-agent-logs-metrics%2Faccess-agent-review-card-justification.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fmedia%2Faccess-review-agent-logs-metrics%2Faccess-agent-review-card-justification.png?ref=cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"de7942217420fc9f05e604c64a3a2d6efe8abef6\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/conditional-access/TOC.yml\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00/docs%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2FTOC.yml\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00/docs%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2FTOC.yml\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2FTOC.yml?ref=cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -16,8 +16,6 @@\\\\n     href: agent-optimization-logs-metrics.md\\\\n   - name: Phased rollout\\\\n     href: agent-optimization-phased-rollout.md\\\\n-  - name: Optimization agent FAQ\\\\n-    href: agent-optimization-faq.yml\\\\n - name: Tutorials\\\\n   items:\\\\n   - name: Require multifactor authentication\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"07d1c53fd8143aadaed8d45b5ca6304c91ca4783\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/conditional-access/agent-optimization-phased-rollout.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 54,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 35,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 89,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00/docs%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2Fagent-optimization-phased-rollout.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00/docs%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2Fagent-optimization-phased-rollout.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fconditional-access%2Fagent-optimization-phased-rollout.md?ref=cbac067e3847353c7132c31656c08ea56cd0aa00\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,87 +6,106 @@ author: shlipsey3\\\\n manager: pmwongera\\\\n \\\\n ms.reviewer: lhuangnorth\\\\n-ms.date: 08/12/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 08/28/2025\\\\n \\\\n ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.subservice: conditional-access\\\\n ms.topic: concept-article\\\\n ms.custom: security-copilot\\\\n ms.collection: msec-ai-copilot\\\\n ---\\\\n-# Conditional Access optimization agent phased rollout (preview)\\\\n+# Conditional Access optimization agent phased rollout\\\\n \\\\n-The Conditional Access optimization agent for Microsoft Entra includes a preview phased rollout capability that helps organizations deploy new Conditional Access policies safely and efficiently.

The agent analyzes sign-in data and existing policies to define a phased rollout plan. There are three main steps in the phased rollout process.\\\\n+When the Conditional Access optimization agent creates a new policy in report-only mode, it can suggest turning on the policy with a phased rollout. The agent analyzes sign-in data and existing policies to define a phased rollout plan.\\\\n+\\\\n+Policies that are intended to apply to *all users* and need to be turned on are eligible for a phased rollout. Because there are five distinct phases to a rollout plan, you must have at least five groups for the rollout plan to apply. To determine which groups to use, the agent looks at groups that were previously or are currently used in Conditional Access policies. The agent looks at those groups to see how other Conditional Access policies affected them, to gauge potential impact. The agent looks at the size of the groups and then uses all these factors to assign the groups to the phases starting with the low impact groups and ending with the higher-impact groups.\\\\n+\\\\n+There are three steps in the phased rollout process:\\\\n \\\\n-### Agent creates a report-only policy with a phased rollout\\\\n+1.

The date has also been advanced.\n\nThirdly, minor edits have been made to the \"Access Review Agent Logs and Metrics\" and \"Access Review Agent\" documentation, including an image alt-text correction and the addition of language support information for the agent.\n\nFinally, extensive revisions have been made to the \"Conditional Access optimization agent phased rollout\" documentation. This includes removing the \"preview\" label, expanding on the phased rollout process, adding new screenshots, and detailing the automatic and manual execution of rollout plans. Additionally, the \"Conditional Access optimization agent\" documentation has been updated to reflect the removal of the \"preview\" label for chat capabilities, the addition of \"deep analysis\" as a suggestion type, and the inclusion of Intune integration details.

The agent then analyzes identified reviews by gathering extra insights, and generates a recommendation (approve / deny) and a justification summary for each decision. Once the agent analyzes the recommendations and corresponding justification summaries, it's able to guide reviewers, in natural language, through the review process in Microsoft Teams. Reviewers are empowered to complete their reviews through the natural language chat experience in Microsoft Teams. As the agent guides them through the review, they're able to review the agent's reasoning behind the recommendations, ask questions in the context of the review itself, and finally make their own informed decision.\\\\n+\\\\n+The agents recommendation (approve / deny) for each decision relies on a deterministic scoring mechanism powered by multiple signals. The signals used for the recommendation are then used to provide an end-user friendly justification summary powered by a large language model (LLM). The subsequent natural language chat experience in Microsoft Teams is facilitated by the large language model with previously generated recommendations and justification summaries as available context.\\\\n+\\\\n+The agent considers the following signals:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **User inactivity**: If the user has [signed in](review-recommendations-access-reviews.md#inactive-user-recommendations)\\\\n+- **User-to-Group affiliation**: If the user has a [low affiliation](review-recommendations-access-reviews.md#user-to-group-affiliation) with other users who have this access\\\\n+- **Account enabled**: If the user's account is enabled (accountEnabled property)\\\\n+- **Employment status**: If the user's employment ended ([employeeLeaveDateTime property](/graph/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows-set-employeeleavedatetime))\\\\n+- **Lifecycle workflow history**: If the user has had a mover workflow ran for them in the past 30 days\\\\n+- **Decisions from previous reviews**: For recurring reviews, decisions from previous review iterations are considered\\\\n+- **Access request history**: For access package assignment reviews, the request and approval history is considered\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> The justification summary includes information from these signals and is available to the reviewer during the review process even though some of this information isn't available to reviewers outside of the review process.\\\\n+\\\\n+As an admin you're able to review the recommendations (approve / deny) and justification summaries. For details see, [Access Review Agent logs and metrics (Preview)](access-review-agent-logs-metrics.md). Note the agent recommendations can differ from the recommendations shown on the My Access portal and Access Review experience in the Microsoft Entra admin center.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Getting started\\\\n+### Setting up the Access Review Agent\\\\n+1. With an account that has at least **all** the following roles, sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com):\\\\n+   - [Identity Governance  Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator)\\\\n+   - [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator)\\\\n+   - [Security Copilot Contributor](/copilot/security/authentication#assign-security-copilot-access)\\\\n+1. From the new home page, select **Go to agents** from the agent notification card.\\\\n+   - You can also select **Agents** from the left navigation menu.\\\\n+   :::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/access-review-agent/start-access-review-agent.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of starting the Access Review Agent.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/access-review-agent/start-access-review-agent.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+1. Select **View details** on the Access Review Agent tile.\\\\n+    \\\\n+1. Select **Start agent** to begin your first run. \\\\n+   - Avoid using an account with a role activated through PIM.\\\\n+   - A message that says \\\\\\\"*The agent is starting its first run*\\\\\\\" appears in the upper-right corner.\\\\n+   - The first run might take a few minutes to complete.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Enable the access review agent for existing access reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+After the Access Review Agent is started, you must flag access reviews to be processed by the Access Review Agent. The Access Review Agent is able to process both new, and existing, access reviews. The following sections walk you through flagging access review to be processed by the Access Review Agent.\\\\n+\\\\n+#### Enable the access review agent for existing group and application access reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+To update an existing access review to be processed by the Access Review Agent, perform the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Access reviews**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select the access review you want the agent to support.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the access review overview page, select **Settings** under Manage if it's a one time review, or **Settings** under Series if it's a recurring review.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under **Advanced Settings**, check the box on the setting that says **Access Review Agent (Preview)**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Save**. \\\\n+\\\\n+#### Enable the Access Review Agent for existing access package assignment reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+To update an existing access review to be processed by the Access Review Agent, perform the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Entitlement management** > **Access package**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select the access package you want the agent to support.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the access package overview page, select **Policies**, then select the policy you want to update and select **Edit**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the edit policy page, select **Lifecycle**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the lifecycle tab, select Advanced Access Review settings and check the **Enable** box on the setting that says **Access Review Agent (Preview)**.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select **Save**.    \\\\n+\\\\n+### Ensure reviewers can use the Access Review Agent\\\\n+\\\\n+Reviewers access the Access Review Agent through a [Microsoft Teams App](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3). If your organizations' [Microsoft Teams org-wide app settings](/microsoftteams/manage-apps#manage-org-wide-app-settings) allow Microsoft applications no action is required. If your organization has disabled Microsoft apps in the Microsoft Teams org-wide app settings your organizations' Microsoft Teams administrator must explicitly approve the app.\\\\n+\\\\n+You must also ensure that all reviewers have at least the [Security Copilot Contributor](/copilot/security/authentication#assign-security-copilot-access) role so that they can use the agent to complete their reviews. This is required because the natural language conversation in Microsoft Teams is opening a Microsoft Security Copilot session behind the scenes. Participating reviewers access the agentic experience via Microsoft Teams, but with the role assignment they'll be entitled to access the [Security Copilot portal](https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com/) or the Security Copilot experience in other Microsoft Security administrative portals. If reviewers access Security Copilot outside of Microsoft Teams, their data access with Security Copilot is still subject to [default user permissions](../fundamentals/users-default-permissions.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Using the Access Review Agent as a reviewer\\\\n+\\\\n+With the Access Review Agent started, reviewers assigned proper permissions, and with the app available to them, your reviewers are now ready to complete their reviews with the help of the agent. The Access Review Agent can be accessed directly within Microsoft Teams ([direct link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3)). The access review email notifications sent to reviewers will also include a direct link to Microsoft Teams.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Open your Microsoft Teams application signed in as the user assigned as a reviewer.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select the [Access Review Agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3) link to open the agent\\\\n+\\\\n+1. On the Apps page, search **Access Review Agent**, and select **Add**.\\\\n+    :::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/access-review-agent/access-review-agent-teams.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the Access Review Agent application in Microsoft Teams.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+1.

You can run it at a specific time by toggling the **Trigger** setting off, and then back on when you want it to run.\\\\n+\\\\n+   :::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/access-review-agent/access-review-agent-trigger.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the Access Review Agent trigger.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> If reviewers immediately respond to their access review email notifications, the agent might not have yet processed the review. Only after the agent runs is it able to assist with access reviews in Microsoft Teams. If you respond before the agent processes the review, the agent responds with the following message to the reviewer in Microsoft Teams: '*I don't see any pending reviews that I can help you with at this time. Because my capabilities are still expanding, I recommend you check the My Access Portal to see if you have any other pending reviews.*'\\\\n+\\\\n+## Removing the agent \\\\n+\\\\n+If you no longer wish to use the Access Review Agent, select **Remove agent** from the top of the agent window. The existing agent activity and metrics are removed but recommendations and justifications for already processed reviews are retained by the agent in Microsoft Teams and continue to be able to assist reviewers with these reviews. To complete the removal, you should also unflag the access reviews previously flagged to be processed by the agent.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Disable the access review agent for existing group and application access reviews\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

with a feature called access reviews. This article covers how a designated reviewer performs an access review for members of a group or users with access to an application. If you want to review access to an access package, read [Review access of an access package in entitlement management](entitlement-management-access-reviews-review-access.md).\\\\n \\\\n-## Perform access review by using My Access\\\\n-You can review access to groups and applications via My Access. My Access is a user-friendly portal for granting, approving, and reviewing access needs.\\\\n+You can review access to groups and applications via the [My Access portal](https://myaccess.microsoft.com/) or via chat with the [Access Review Agent (Preview)](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3) in Microsoft Teams. The Access Review Agent is currently in preview and does not yet support all types of group and application reviews, if the agent cannot yet help you with your assigned reviews it will guide you to the My Access portal.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Perform an access review using the Access Review Agent (Preview)\\\\n+The Access Review Agent assists you in completing your pending access reviews by guiding you in Microsoft Teams with natural language, insights, and recommendations.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Go directly to the Access Review Agent\\\\n+1. Select the [Access Review Agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3) link to open the agent\\\\n+1. Select **Add** or **Open** to access the conversation with the Access Review Agent\\\\n+1. Prompt the agent with **Help me with my access reviews** and the agent will assist you in completing your pending access reviews.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Use email to go to the Access Review Agent\\\\n+\\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> There could be delays in receiving email. In some cases, it could take up to 24 hours. Add MSSecurity-noreply@microsoft.com to your safe recipients list to make sure that you're receiving all emails.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Look for an email from Microsoft asking you to review access.\\\\n+1. Select the **Start review** link to open the [Access Review Agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/b99caf01-1dd7-43cf-981a-0de444e783f3). The **Start review** link will either open the Access Review Agent or the My Access portal based on your organizations policies. If the link opens the My Access portal the Access Review Agent has not been enabled for the specific review and must be completed via the My Access portal.\\\\n+1.

In this policy, Microsoft Entra Internet Access blocks traffic based on domain and URL indicators from both Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence providers. With the threat intelligence rule engine, you can also configure allow lists for handling false positives. All of these policies can become context-aware with the Security Profile framework, linking Global Secure Access (GSA) security policies to Conditional Access. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-- Administrators who interact with **Global Secure Access** features must have one or more of the following role assignments depending on the tasks they're performing.\\\\n-   - The [Global Secure Access Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) role to manage the Global Secure Access features.\\\\n-   - The [Conditional Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#conditional-access-administrator) to create and interact with Conditional Access policies.\\\\n-- Complete the [Get started with Global Secure Access](how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access.md) guide.\\\\n-- [Install the Global Secure Access client](how-to-install-windows-client.md) on end user devices.\\\\n-- You must disable Domain Name System (DNS) over HTTPS (Secure DNS) to tunnel network traffic. Use the rules of the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) in the traffic forwarding profile. For more information, see [Configure the DNS client to support DoH](/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support#configure-the-dns-client-to-support-doh).\\\\n-- Disable built-in DNS client on Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\\\\n-- IPv6 traffic isn't acquired by the client and is therefore transferred directly to the network. To enable all relevant traffic to be tunneled, set the network adapter properties to [IPv4 preferred](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check.md#ipv4-preferred).\\\\n-- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic (that is, QUIC) isn't supported in the current preview of Internet Access. Most websites support fallback to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) when QUIC can't be established. For an improved user experience, you can deploy a Windows Firewall rule that blocks outbound UDP 443: \\\\n-\\\\n-```powershell \\\\n-@New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Block QUIC\\\\\\\" -Direction Outbound -Action Block -Protocol UDP  -RemotePort 443\\\\n-``` \\\\n-\\\\n-- (Optional) [Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection](how-to-transport-layer-security.md) in order for URL indicators to be evaluated against HTTPS traffic.\\\\n-\\\\n-## High level steps\\\\n-\\\\n-There are several steps to configuring threat intelligence. Take note of where you need to configure a Conditional Access policy.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. [Enable internet traffic forwarding.](#enable-internet-traffic-forwarding)\\\\n-1. [Create a threat intelligence policy.](#create-a-threat-intelligence-policy)\\\\n-1. [Configure your allow list (optional).](#configure-your-allow-list-optional)\\\\n-1. [Create a security profile.](#create-a-security-profile-or-configure-the-baseline-profile)\\\\n-1. [Link the security profile to a Conditional Access policy.](#create-and-link-conditional-access-policy)\\\\n-\\\\n-## Enable internet traffic forwarding\\\\n-\\\\n-The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile. To learn more about the profile and how to enable it, see [How to manage the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile](how-to-manage-internet-access-profile.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-You can scope the Internet Access profile to specific users and groups. To learn more about user and group assignment, see [How to assign and manage users and groups with traffic forwarding profiles](how-to-manage-users-groups-assignment.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Create a threat intelligence policy\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**.\\\\n-1. Select **Create policy**.\\\\n-1. Enter a name and description for the policy and select **Next**.\\\\n-1. The default action for threat intelligence is \\\\\\\"Allow\\\\\\\". This means that if traffic doesn't match a rule in the threat intelligence policy, the policy engine will allow the traffic to go to the next security control.\\\\n-1. Select **Next** and **Review** your new threat intelligence policy.\\\\n-1. Select **Create**\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> This policy is created with a rule blocking access to destinations where high severity threats are detected. Microsoft defines high severity threats as domains or URLs associated with active malware distribution, phishing campaigns, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and other threads, identified by Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence feeds with high confidence.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Configure your allow list (optional)\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're aware of sites that may be business-critical or are labeled as false positives, you can configure rules that allow these sites. Note the security risks involved with this action, as the internet threat landscape is ever-changing.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Under **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**, select your chosen threat intelligence policy.\\\\n-1. Select **Rules**.\\\\n-1. Select **Add rule**.\\\\n-1. Enter a name, description, priority, and status for the rule.\\\\n-1. Edit **Destination FQDNs** and select the list of domains for your allow list. You can enter these FQDNs as comma-separated domains.\\\\n-1. Select **Add**. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Create a security profile or configure the baseline profile\\\\n-\\\\n-Security profiles are a grouping of security controls like web content filtering and threat intelligence policies. You can assign, or link, security profiles with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies. One security profile can contain a policy of each type.\\\\n-\\\\n-In this step, you create a security profile to group filtering policies like web content filtering and/or threat intelligence. Then you assign, or link, the security profiles with a Conditional Access policy to make them user or context aware.\\\\n-\\\\n-Since threat intelligence is critical for users' basic security posture, you can alternatively link your threat intelligence policy to the baseline security profile, which applies policy to all users' traffic in your tenant.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> You can only configure threat intelligence policy per security profile. Rule priorities within each security control handle exceptions, and security controls follow the ordering, (1) TLS inspection > (2) Web content filtering > (3) Threat intelligence > (4) File type > (6) Data loss prevention > (7) Third-party\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Security profiles**.\\\\n-2. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n-3. Enter a name and description for the profile and select **Next**.\\\\n-4. Select **Link a policy** and then select **Existing threat intelligence policy**.\\\\n-5. Select the threat intelligence policy you already created and select **Add**.\\\\n-6. Select **Next** to review the security profile and associated policy.\\\\n-7. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n-8. Select **Refresh** to view the new profile.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Create and link Conditional Access policy\\\\n-\\\\n-Create a Conditional Access policy for end users or groups and deliver your security profile through Conditional Access Session controls. Conditional Access is the delivery mechanism for user and context awareness for Internet Access policies.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Browse to **Identity** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.\\\\n-2. Select **Create new policy**.\\\\n-3. Enter a name and assign a user or group.\\\\n-4. Select **Target resources** and **All internet resources with Global Secure Access**.\\\\n-5. Select **Session** > **Use Global Secure Access security profile** and choose a security profile.\\\\n-6. Select **Select**.\\\\n-7. In the **Enable policy** section, ensure **On** is selected.\\\\n-8. Select **Create**.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Applying a new security profile can take up to 60-90 minutes because security profiles are enforced via access tokens.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Verify end user policy enforcement\\\\n-\\\\n-Use a Windows device with the Global Secure Access client installed. Sign in as a user that is assigned the Internet traffic acquisition profile. Test that navigating to malicious websites is blocked as expected.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> After configuring a threat intelligence policy, you may need to [clear your browser's cache](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/learning-center/how-to-manage-and-clear-your-cache-and-cookies) to validate policy enforcement.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Right-click on the Global Secure Access client icon in the task manager tray and open **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Forwarding profile**. Ensure that the Internet access acquisition rules are present.\\\\n-1. Navigate to a known malicious site (for example, `entratestthreat.com` or `smartscreentestratings2.net`). Ensure that you're blocked and that the Threat Type field is nonempty in the traffic logs. Traffic logs may take up to 5 minutes to appear in the portal.\\\\n-1. If blocked by Windows Defender or Smart screen, override and access the site to test the Global Secure Access block message. You can do this by choosing \\\\\\\"Continue to the unsafe site (not recommended)\\\\\\\" under \\\\\\\"More information.\\\\\\\"\\\\n-1. To test allow-listing, create a rule in the Threat Intelligence policy to allow access to the site. Within 2 minutes, you should be able to access it. (You may need to clear your browser cache.)\\\\n-1. Evaluate the rest of the threat feed against your known threat indicators.\\\\n-\\\\n-![Screenshot showing a plaintext browser error for unencrypted or TLS inspected HTTP traffic.](media/how-to-configure-threat-intelligence/http-block-ti.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!CAUTION]\\\\n-> Testing with real malicious sites should be performed in a sandbox or test environment to protect your device and enterprise.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- [Learn about the traffic dashboard](concept-traffic-dashboard.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"cbbf295e0dd6a4b231a1c18478e74b4fe9250162\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 3,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 4,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/6edd24301d6ccf0f26f4ffa973c0a467f4257a80/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/6edd24301d6ccf0f26f4ffa973c0a467f4257a80/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md?ref=6edd24301d6ccf0f26f4ffa973c0a467f4257a80\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -57,6 +57,8 @@ The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile.

In this policy, Microsoft Entra Internet Access blocks traffic based on domain and URL indicators from both Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence providers. With the threat intelligence rule engine, you can also configure allow lists for handling false positives. All of these policies can become context-aware with the Security Profile framework, linking Global Secure Access (GSA) security policies to Conditional Access. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-- Administrators who interact with **Global Secure Access** features must have one or more of the following role assignments depending on the tasks they're performing.\\\\n-   - The [Global Secure Access Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) role to manage the Global Secure Access features.\\\\n-   - The [Conditional Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#conditional-access-administrator) to create and interact with Conditional Access policies.\\\\n-- Complete the [Get started with Global Secure Access](how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access.md) guide.\\\\n-- [Install the Global Secure Access client](how-to-install-windows-client.md) on end user devices.\\\\n-- You must disable Domain Name System (DNS) over HTTPS (Secure DNS) to tunnel network traffic. Use the rules of the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) in the traffic forwarding profile. For more information, see [Configure the DNS client to support DoH](/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support#configure-the-dns-client-to-support-doh).\\\\n-- Disable built-in DNS client on Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\\\\n-- IPv6 traffic isn't acquired by the client and is therefore transferred directly to the network. To enable all relevant traffic to be tunneled, set the network adapter properties to [IPv4 preferred](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check.md#ipv4-preferred).\\\\n-- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic (that is, QUIC) isn't supported in the current preview of Internet Access. Most websites support fallback to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) when QUIC can't be established. For an improved user experience, you can deploy a Windows Firewall rule that blocks outbound UDP 443: \\\\n-\\\\n-```powershell \\\\n-@New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Block QUIC\\\\\\\" -Direction Outbound -Action Block -Protocol UDP  -RemotePort 443\\\\n-``` \\\\n-\\\\n-- (Optional) [Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection](how-to-transport-layer-security.md) in order for URL indicators to be evaluated against HTTPS traffic.\\\\n-\\\\n-## High level steps\\\\n-\\\\n-There are several steps to configuring threat intelligence. Take note of where you need to configure a Conditional Access policy.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. [Enable internet traffic forwarding.](#enable-internet-traffic-forwarding)\\\\n-1. [Create a threat intelligence policy.](#create-a-threat-intelligence-policy)\\\\n-1. [Configure your allow list (optional).](#configure-your-allow-list-optional)\\\\n-1. [Create a security profile.](#create-a-security-profile-or-configure-the-baseline-profile)\\\\n-1. [Link the security profile to a Conditional Access policy.](#create-and-link-conditional-access-policy)\\\\n-\\\\n-## Enable internet traffic forwarding\\\\n-\\\\n-The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile. To learn more about the profile and how to enable it, see [How to manage the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile](how-to-manage-internet-access-profile.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-You can scope the Internet Access profile to specific users and groups. To learn more about user and group assignment, see [How to assign and manage users and groups with traffic forwarding profiles](how-to-manage-users-groups-assignment.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Create a threat intelligence policy\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**.\\\\n-1. Select **Create policy**.\\\\n-1. Enter a name and description for the policy and select **Next**.\\\\n-1. The default action for threat intelligence is \\\\\\\"Allow\\\\\\\". This means that if traffic doesn't match a rule in the threat intelligence policy, the policy engine will allow the traffic to go to the next security control.\\\\n-1. Select **Next** and **Review** your new threat intelligence policy.\\\\n-1. Select **Create**\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> This policy is created with a rule blocking access to destinations where high severity threats are detected. Microsoft defines high severity threats as domains or URLs associated with active malware distribution, phishing campaigns, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and other threads, identified by Microsoft and third-party threat intelligence feeds with high confidence.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Configure your allow list (optional)\\\\n-\\\\n-If you're aware of sites that may be business-critical or are labeled as false positives, you can configure rules that allow these sites. Note the security risks involved with this action, as the internet threat landscape is ever-changing.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Under **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Threat Intelligence Policies**, select your chosen threat intelligence policy.\\\\n-1. Select **Rules**.\\\\n-1. Select **Add rule**.\\\\n-1. Enter a name, description, priority, and status for the rule.\\\\n-1. Edit **Destination FQDNs** and select the list of domains for your allow list. You can enter these FQDNs as comma-separated domains.\\\\n-1. Select **Add**. \\\\n-\\\\n-## Create a security profile or configure the baseline profile\\\\n-\\\\n-Security profiles are a grouping of security controls like web content filtering and threat intelligence policies. You can assign, or link, security profiles with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies. One security profile can contain a policy of each type.\\\\n-\\\\n-In this step, you create a security profile to group filtering policies like web content filtering and/or threat intelligence. Then you assign, or link, the security profiles with a Conditional Access policy to make them user or context aware.\\\\n-\\\\n-Since threat intelligence is critical for users' basic security posture, you can alternatively link your threat intelligence policy to the baseline security profile, which applies policy to all users' traffic in your tenant.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> You can only configure threat intelligence policy per security profile. Rule priorities within each security control handle exceptions, and security controls follow the ordering, (1) TLS inspection > (2) Web content filtering > (3) Threat intelligence > (4) File type > (6) Data loss prevention > (7) Third-party\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Secure** > **Security profiles**.\\\\n-2. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n-3. Enter a name and description for the profile and select **Next**.\\\\n-4. Select **Link a policy** and then select **Existing threat intelligence policy**.\\\\n-5. Select the threat intelligence policy you already created and select **Add**.\\\\n-6. Select **Next** to review the security profile and associated policy.\\\\n-7. Select **Create profile**.\\\\n-8. Select **Refresh** to view the new profile.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Create and link Conditional Access policy\\\\n-\\\\n-Create a Conditional Access policy for end users or groups and deliver your security profile through Conditional Access Session controls. Conditional Access is the delivery mechanism for user and context awareness for Internet Access policies.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Browse to **Identity** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.\\\\n-2. Select **Create new policy**.\\\\n-3. Enter a name and assign a user or group.\\\\n-4. Select **Target resources** and **All internet resources with Global Secure Access**.\\\\n-5. Select **Session** > **Use Global Secure Access security profile** and choose a security profile.\\\\n-6. Select **Select**.\\\\n-7. In the **Enable policy** section, ensure **On** is selected.\\\\n-8. Select **Create**.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Applying a new security profile can take up to 60-90 minutes because security profiles are enforced via access tokens.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Verify end user policy enforcement\\\\n-\\\\n-Use a Windows device with the Global Secure Access client installed. Sign in as a user that is assigned the Internet traffic acquisition profile. Test that navigating to malicious websites is blocked as expected.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> After configuring a threat intelligence policy, you may need to [clear your browser's cache](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/learning-center/how-to-manage-and-clear-your-cache-and-cookies) to validate policy enforcement.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Right-click on the Global Secure Access client icon in the task manager tray and open **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Forwarding profile**. Ensure that the Internet access acquisition rules are present.\\\\n-1. Navigate to a known malicious site (for example, `entratestthreat.com` or `smartscreentestratings2.net`). Ensure that you're blocked and that the Threat Type field is nonempty in the traffic logs. Traffic logs may take up to 5 minutes to appear in the portal.\\\\n-1. If blocked by Windows Defender or Smart screen, override and access the site to test the Global Secure Access block message. You can do this by choosing \\\\\\\"Continue to the unsafe site (not recommended)\\\\\\\" under \\\\\\\"More information.\\\\\\\"\\\\n-1. To test allow-listing, create a rule in the Threat Intelligence policy to allow access to the site. Within 2 minutes, you should be able to access it. (You may need to clear your browser cache.)\\\\n-1. Evaluate the rest of the threat feed against your known threat indicators.\\\\n-\\\\n-![Screenshot showing a plaintext browser error for unencrypted or TLS inspected HTTP traffic.](media/how-to-configure-threat-intelligence/http-block-ti.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!CAUTION]\\\\n-> Testing with real malicious sites should be performed in a sandbox or test environment to protect your device and enterprise.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- [Learn about the traffic dashboard](concept-traffic-dashboard.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"cbbf295e0dd6a4b231a1c18478e74b4fe9250162\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 3,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 4,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/ce76f893479e26295a95c2283aff4e21c43dd903/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/ce76f893479e26295a95c2283aff4e21c43dd903/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-configure-web-content-filtering.md?ref=ce76f893479e26295a95c2283aff4e21c43dd903\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -57,6 +57,8 @@ The first step is to enable the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile.

saas-apps\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 03/25/2025\\\\n-ms.author: jeedes\\\\n-\\\\n-# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to automatically provision and deprovision user accounts from Microsoft Entra ID to GitHub AE so that I can streamline the user management process and ensure that users have the appropriate access to GitHub AE.\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Configure GitHub AE for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n-\\\\n-This article describes the steps you need to perform in both GitHub AE and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and/or groups to GitHub AE using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n-## Capabilities supported\\\\n-> [!div class=\\\\\\\"checklist\\\\\\\"]\\\\n-> * Create users in GitHub AE\\\\n-> * Remove users in GitHub AE when they don't require access anymore\\\\n-> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and GitHub AE\\\\n-> * Provision groups and group memberships in GitHub AE\\\\n-> * Single sign-on to [GitHub AE](./github-ae-tutorial.md) (recommended)\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n-The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:\\\\n-\\\\n-[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]\\\\n-* GitHub AE, fully [initialized](https://docs.github.com/github-ae@latest/admin/configuration/initializing-github-ae) and configured for login with [SAML SSO](https://docs.github.com/github-ae@latest/admin/authentication/configuring-authentication-and-provisioning-for-your-enterprise-using-azure-ad) through your Microsoft Entra tenant.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment\\\\n-1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).\\\\n-2. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).\\\\n-3. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and GitHub AE](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='step-2-configure-github-ae-to-support-provisioning-with-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 2: Configure GitHub AE to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n-\\\\n-Learn how to enable provisioning for GitHub AE [here](https://docs.github.com/github-ae@latest/admin/authentication/configuring-user-provisioning-for-your-enterprise).\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='step-3-add-github-ae-from-the-azure-ad-application-gallery'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 3: Add GitHub AE from the Microsoft Entra application gallery\\\\n-\\\\n-Add GitHub AE from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to GitHub AE. If you have previously setup GitHub AE for SSO, you can use the same application. However, we recommend that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning \\\\n-\\\\n-[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-provisioning.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-provisioning.md)]\\\\n-\\\\n-## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to GitHub AE \\\\n-\\\\n-This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n-\\\\n-<a name='to-configure-automatic-user-provisioning-for-github-ae-in-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n-\\\\n-### To configure automatic user provisioning for GitHub AE in Microsoft Entra ID:\\\\n-\\\\n-1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).\\\\n-1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the applications list, select **GitHub AE**.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![The GitHub AE link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your GitHub AE **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** retrieved earlier from Step 2. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to GitHub AE. If the connection fails, ensure your GitHub AE account has Admin permissions and try again.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-7. Select **Save**.\\\\n-\\\\n-8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users** to **GitHub AE**.\\\\n-\\\\n-9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to GitHub AE in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in GitHub AE for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the GitHub AE API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.\\\\n-\\\\n-   |Attribute|Type|\\\\n-   |---|---|\\\\n-   |userName|String|\\\\n-   |externalId|String|\\\\n-   |emails[type eq \\\\\\\"work\\\\\\\"].value|String|\\\\n-   |active|Boolean|\\\\n-   |name.givenName|String|\\\\n-   |name.familyName|String|\\\\n-   |name.formatted|String|\\\\n-   |displayName|String|\\\\n-\\\\n-10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to GitHub AE**.\\\\n-\\\\n-11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to GitHub AE in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in GitHub AE for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.\\\\n-\\\\n-      |Attribute|Type|\\\\n-      |---|---|\\\\n-      |displayName|String|\\\\n-      |externalId|String|\\\\n-      |members|Reference|\\\\n-\\\\n-12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-13. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for GitHub AE, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\t![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)\\\\n-\\\\n-14.

When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and/or groups to GitHub Enterprise Server using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Capabilities supported\\\\n+> [!div class=\\\\\\\"checklist\\\\\\\"]\\\\n+> * Create users in GitHub Enterprise Server\\\\n+> * Remove users in GitHub Enterprise Server when they don't require access anymore\\\\n+> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and GitHub Enterprise Server\\\\n+> * Provision groups and group memberships in GitHub Enterprise Server\\\\n+> * Single sign-on to [GitHub Enterprise Server](./github-enterprise-server-tutorial.md) (recommended)\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]\\\\n+* GitHub Enterprise Server, fully [initialized](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server) and configured for login with [SAML SSO](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise) through your Microsoft Entra tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment\\\\n+1.

Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).\\\\n+1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**\\\\n+\\\\n+    ![Screenshot of the Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the applications list, select **GitHub Enterprise Server**.\\\\n+\\\\n+    ![Screenshot of the GitHub Enterprise Server link highlighted in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.\\\\n+\\\\n+    ![Screenshot of the Provisioning tab selected in the application menu.](common/provisioning.png)\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.\\\\n+\\\\n+    ![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown set to Automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your GitHub Enterprise Server **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**. The values of the fields are in the following format:\\\\n+\\\\n+    * **Tenant URL**: `https://<your-github-server-domain>/api/v3/scim`\\\\n+    * **Secret Token**: [The Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-users#2-create-a-personal-access-token) you created for [the provisioning account](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-users#1-create-a-built-in-setup-user) in your GitHub Enterprise Server instance.\\\\n+\\\\n+    Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to GitHub Enterprise Server.

To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for GitHub Enterprise Server, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.\\\\n+\\\\n+    ![Screenshot of the Provisioning Status toggle switched to the On position.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

        "Response": "These commits primarily update metadata across various Microsoft Entra ID documentation pages. The key change is the consistent addition of `ms.subservice: workforce` to a wide range of articles, including primers, developer guides, tutorials, and scenario-specific pages. This adjustment likely categorises or tags these documents more accurately within the broader Microsoft Entra product suite, potentially for better organisation or searchability. Additionally, a minor correction was made to an example query in the dynamic membership documentation to refine the `deviceOSType` attribute for iOS devices.",

        "Response": "The documentation for Microsoft Entra External ID has been updated to include information on regional opt-in for MFA telephony verification in August 2025. Several existing articles have also seen updates, with a focus on new videos, API changes, and general availability announcements for features like SAML/WS-Fed federation.\n\nAdditionally, the FAQ for Global Secure Access has been clarified to specify the required cryptographic algorithms for TLS inspection certificates, supporting SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\n\nFinally, an update to the Microsoft Entra ID Governance documentation clarifies that the execution user scope list displays all users meeting the conditions, regardless of whether they have already been processed by the workflow.",

        "Response": "The commit modifies a documentation page regarding checking workflow execution scope in Microsoft Entra ID. It clarifies that the displayed list of users under the execution scope includes all users meeting the criteria, regardless of whether they have already been processed by the workflow. Additionally, a note is updated to emphasize that the workflow engine evaluates users irrespective of prior processing, and the results' timeliness depends on recent changes to execution conditions or user attributes.",

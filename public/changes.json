They are vulnerable to a wide range of threats—including phishing, credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and social engineering. To realize the benefits of passwordless authentication in Microsoft Entra ID, you must ensure passwords are no longer available as a sign-in option in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Password scrambling ensures that users can't authenticate using passwords. It forces them to use more secure passwordless credentials like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 security keys, or Microsoft Authenticator. This article provides guidance about how to scramble passwords for both hybrid users who are synced from on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and cloud-only users in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+ \\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Microsoft Entra Connect sync [version 2.4.18.0 or later](~/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md#password-hash-synchronization-and-smart-card-authentication)\\\\n+\\\\n+## Scramble passwords for hybrid user accounts synced from on-premises AD DS\\\\n+\\\\n+Organizations with users synced from on-premises AD DS to Microsoft Entra ID should scramble user passwords in the on-premises environment, as on-premises is the source of authority for synced user accounts and their passwords. If your organization uses [cloud authentication](~/identity/hybrid/connect/choose-ad-authn.md) and syncs password hashes to Microsoft Entra ID, then these scrambled passwords are also synced to the cloud. The sync process ensures that users aren't aware of their passwords in either on-premises or the cloud, preventing their use and driving users towards using more secure phishing-resistant passwordless credentials.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Option 1: Scramble on-premises user passwords with Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL)\\\\n+\\\\n+Scrambling user passwords with the Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL) setting is the recommended method for scrambling user passwords on-premises because it's a natively available option in AD DS. When SCRIL is enabled on a user object, the user’s AD DS password is randomized by the domain controller to a value no one knows. The user has to enroll and then must authenticate to the AD DS domain by using a smart card or Windows Hello for Business. With password hash synchronization enabled, this AD DS password hash is also synced with Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+The Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon setting can be configured using the Active Directory Users and Computers tool. The following sample PowerShell script can be used to enable the setting programmatically, including for many users at once. Modify the **samAccountName** variable of the script to match your environment, and then run it in a PowerShell session. Use the credentials of an admin account with appropriate permissions in on-premises AD.\\\\n+\\\\n+```PowerShell\\\\n+$samAccountName = <sAMAccountName of the user>\\\\n+\\\\n+Import-Module ActiveDirectory\\\\n+Set-ADUser -Identity $samAccountName -SmartcardLogonRequired $true\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+### Option 2: Scramble on-premises user passwords with a scripted random value\\\\n+\\\\n+If you don't want to use Smart Card Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL), another approach can be to scramble the password with a script. If users need to recover their passwords to access legacy apps, use a script to scramble the password. Run the script routinely to scramble any passwords that users reset back to a known state.\\\\n+\\\\n+The following sample PowerShell script generates a random password of 64 characters and sets it for the user specified in the variable name **$samAccountName** against on-premises AD DS domain. Modify the **$samAccountName** variable of the script to match your environment, and then run it in a PowerShell session. Use the credentials of an admin account with appropriate permissions in on-premises AD DS.\\\\n+\\\\n+```PowerShell\\\\n+$samAccountName = <sAMAccountName of the user>\\\\n+\\\\n+Import-Module ActiveDirectory\\\\n+\\\\n+function Generate-RandomPassword{\\\\n+    [CmdletBinding()]\\\\n+    param (\\\\n+      [int]$Length = 64\\\\n+    )\\\\n+  $chars = \\\\\\\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>/?\\\\\\\\|`~\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  $random = New-Object System.Random\\\\n+  $password = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  for ($i = 0; $i -lt $Length; $i++) {\\\\n+    $index = $random.Next(0, $chars.Length)\\\\n+    $password += $chars[$index]\\\\n+  }\\\\n+  return $password\\\\n+}\\\\n+\\\\n+Import-Module ActiveDirectory\\\\n+\\\\n+$NewPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String (Generate-RandomPassword) -AsPlainText -Force\\\\n+\\\\n+Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $samAccountName -NewPassword $NewPassword -Reset\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!CAUTION]\\\\n+> Execute the script only from a secure and trusted environment, and ensure that the script isn't logged. Treat the host where the script is executed as a privileged host, with the same level of security as a domain controller.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Randomize passwords for cloud user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n+\\\\n+Cloud-based passwordless users should have their password set to a random value. Randomizing the password prevents the user from knowing the password and using it to authenticate. Optionally, organizations can allow end users to reset their password if they encounter an application where they need the password. Run the script routinely to scramble any passwords that users have reset back to a known state.\\\\n+\\\\n+The following sample PowerShell script generates a random password of 64 characters and sets it for the user specified in the variable name **$userId** against Microsoft Entra ID. Modify the **$userId** variable of the script to match your environment, and then run it in a PowerShell session. When prompted to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, use the credentials of an account with a role that can reset passwords.\\\\n+\\\\n+```PowerShell\\\\n+$userId = \\\\\\\"<UPN of the user>\\\\\\\"\\\\n+\\\\n+function Generate-RandomPassword{\\\\n+    [CmdletBinding()]\\\\n+    param (\\\\n+      [int]$Length = 64\\\\n+    )\\\\n+  $chars = \\\\\\\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>/?\\\\\\\\|`~\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  $random = New-Object System.Random\\\\n+  $password = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  for ($i = 0; $i -lt $Length; $i++) {\\\\n+    $index = $random.Next(0, $chars.Length)\\\\n+    $password += $chars[$index]\\\\n+  }\\\\n+  return $password\\\\n+}\\\\n+\\\\n+Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force\\\\n+Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser\\\\n+Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Users.Actions\\\\n+Connect-MgGraph -Scopes \\\\\\\"UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All\\\\\\\" -NoWelcome\\\\n+\\\\n+$passwordParams = @{\\\\n+ UserId = $userId\\\\n+ AuthenticationMethodId = \\\\\\\"28c10230-6103-485e-b985-444c60001490\\\\\\\"\\\\n+ NewPassword = Generate-RandomPassword\\\\n+}\\\\n+\\\\n+Reset-MgUserAuthenticationMethodPassword @passwordParams\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!CAUTION]\\\\n+> Execute the script only from a secure and trusted environment, and ensure that the script isn't logged.

Consider disabling tools that let users override the scrambled passwords and gain access to their password again.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Disable self-service password reset (SSPR) tools, including [Microsoft Entra self-service password reset](~/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr-writeback.md#clean-up-resources).\\\\n+- Disable password writeback from [Microsoft Entra to on-premises Active Directory](~/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr-writeback.md#clean-up-resources).\\\\n+- Set your Microsoft Entra password policy to have [no expiry](~/identity/authentication/concept-sspr-policy.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Related content\\\\n+\\\\n+[Deploy a phishing-resistant authentication in Microsoft Entra ID](how-to-deploy-phishing-resistant-passwordless-authentication.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"e0fe0740fb748e255dd6b40ff81d53dcafd7c04b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/hybrid/how-to-group-source-of-authority-configure.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 11,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 13,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/22d21d41be5a9eb696267f36f51a9ae321161c1a/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fhow-to-group-source-of-authority-configure.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/22d21d41be5a9eb696267f36f51a9ae321161c1a/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fhow-to-group-source-of-authority-configure.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fhow-to-group-source-of-authority-configure.md?ref=22d21d41be5a9eb696267f36f51a9ae321161c1a\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,7 +6,7 @@ manager: dougeby\\\\n ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.subservice: hybrid\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 10/02/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 10/13/2025\\\\n ms.author: justinha\\\\n ms.reviewer: dhanyak\\\\n ---\\\\n@@ -69,7 +69,16 @@ Follow these steps to grant `Group-OnPremisesSyncBehavior.ReadWrite.All` permiss\\\\n \\\\n ## Prepare groups for Group SOA conversion and provisioning\\\\n \\\\n-If you want to provision the group back to AD, ensure you can preserve the OU Path and set it in the **Group Provision to AD** configuration with the right mapping.\\\\n+If you want to provision the group back to AD DS, plan to complete the following steps to preserve the OU Path and set it in the **Group Provision to AD** configuration with the right mapping:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Security questions aren't used as an authentication method during a sign-in event. Instead, security questions can be used during the self-service password reset (SSPR) process to confirm who you are. Administrator accounts can't use security questions as verification method with SSPR.\\\\n \\\\n+> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> Allowing security questions as a self-service password reset (SSPR) method weakens the password reset process because answers are frequently guessable, reused across sites, or discoverable through open-source intelligence (OSINT). Threat actors enumerate or phish users, derive likely responses (family names, schools, and locations), and then trigger password reset flows to bypass stronger methods by exploiting the weaker knowledge-based gate.

Open an elevated PowerShell window and run the following commands to install modules and connect: \\\\n+\\\\n+   ```powershell\\\\n+   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Force \\\\n+   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes \\\\\\\"Application.ReadWrite.All\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Directory.ReadWrite.All\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Directory.AccessAsUser.All\\\\\\\" \\\\n+   ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Check if the application exists. If it doesn't, create it. Also ensure a service principal is present. \\\\n+\\\\n+   ```powershell\\\\n+   $tenantId = (Get-MgOrganization).Id \\\\n+   $app = Get-MgApplication -Filter \\\\\\\"identifierUris/any(uri:uri eq 'API://$tenantId/CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp')\\\\\\\" \\\\n+   if (-not $app) { \\\\n+     $app = New-MgApplication -DisplayName \\\\\\\"CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp\\\\\\\" -IdentifierUris \\\\\\\"API://$tenantId/CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp\\\\\\\" \\\\n+   } \\\\n+    \\\\n+   $sp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter \\\\\\\"AppId eq '$($app.AppId)'\\\\\\\" \\\\n+   if (-not $sp) { \\\\n+     $sp = New-MgServicePrincipal -AppId $app.AppId \\\\n+   } \\\\n+   ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Now add a directory extension property named *GroupDN*. This will be a string attribute available on group objects. \\\\n+\\\\n+   ```powershell\\\\n+   New-MgApplicationExtensionProperty ` \\\\n+     -ApplicationId $app.Id ` \\\\n+     -Name \\\\\\\"GroupDN\\\\\\\" ` \\\\n+     -DataType \\\\\\\"String\\\\\\\" ` \\\\n+     -TargetObjects Group \\\\n+   ```\\\\n+   \\\\n+For more information about how to create the directory extension property for groups, see [Cloud sync directory extensions and custom attribute mapping](/entra/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/custom-attribute-mapping).\\\\n+\\\\n+#### [**Graph Explorer**](#tab/ge)\\\\n+ \\\\n+1. Check if application with the identifier URI `API://<tenantId>/CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp` exists.\\\\n+\\\\n+   ```https\\\\n+   GET /applications?$filter=identifierUris/any(uri:uri eq 'api://<tenantId>/CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp')\\\\n+   ```\\\\n+\\\\n+   For more information, see [Get application](/graph/api/application-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true)\\\\n+     \\\\n+1. If the application doesn't exist, create the application with identifier URI `API://<tenantId>/CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp`:\\\\n+\\\\n+   ```https\\\\n+   POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications\\\\n+   Content-type: application/json\\\\n+\\\\n+   {\\\\n+   \\\\\\\"displayName\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp\\\\\\\",\\\\n+   \\\\\\\"identifierUris\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\"api://<tenant id>/CloudSyncCustomExtensionsApp\\\\\\\"]\\\\n+   }\\\\n+   ```\\\\n+   \\\\n+   For more information, see [create application](/graph/api/application-post-applications?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true).\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Create a directory extension in Microsoft Entra ID. For example, a new extension called 'GroupDN', of string type, for Group objects:\\\\n+\\\\n+   ```https\\\\n+   POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/<ApplicationId>/extensionProperties\\\\n+   Content-type: application/json\\\\n+     \\\\n+   {\\\\n+     \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"GroupDN\\\\\\\",\\\\n+     \\\\\\\"dataType\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"String\\\\\\\",\\\\n+     \\\\\\\"isMultiValued\\\\\\\": false,\\\\n+     \\\\\\\"targetObjects\\\\\\\": [\\\\n+         \\\\\\\"Group\\\\\\\"\\\\n+     ]\\\\n+   }    \\\\n+   ```\\\\n+\\\\n+### Configure Cloud Sync attribute mapping\\\\n+\\\\n+Next, tell Cloud Sync to populate this extension property with the group’s Distinguished Name (DN) from Active Directory. This step ensures the original OU and CN information are preserved in Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. Open Microsoft Entra admin center > **Entra ID** > **Entra Connect** > **Cloud Sync**.\\\\n+2. Select your AD-to-Microsoft Entra ID configuration.\\\\n+3. Go to **Attribute mappings**.\\\\n+4. At the top, switch **Object type** to **Group**.\\\\n+5. Add a new attribute mapping.\\\\n+   - Mapping type: Direct\\\\n+   - Source attribute: distinguishedName (the on-premises group’s DN)\\\\n+   - Target attribute: `extension_<appIdWithoutHyphens>_GroupDN`\\\\n+6. Save the schema to trigger a sync.\\\\n+\\\\n+By mapping distinguishedName directly, you capture the group’s full DN (CN + OU path) in the extension property, making it easier to later reconstruct both CN and OU when provisioning back to AD.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Verify that the mapping worked\\\\n+\\\\n+Once sync runs, you should verify that the extension property is populated with the DN. Use Microsoft Graph PowerShell:\\\\n+\\\\n+```powershell\\\\n+$clientId = $app.AppId\\\\n+$propName = \\\\\\\"extension_{0}_GroupDN\\\\\\\" -f ($clientId -replace \\\\\\\"-\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\")\\\\n+$grp = Get-MgGroup -Filter \\\\\\\"displayName eq 'My Security Group'\\\\\\\" -ConsistencyLevel eventual\\\\n+Get-MgGroup -GroupId $grp.Id -Property \\\\\\\"id,displayName,$propName\\\\\\\" |\\\\n+  Select-Object id, displayName, @{n=$propName; e={$_.\\\\\\\"$propName\\\\\\\"}}\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+This command returns the group with its DN stored in the extension property. You can also test using Graph Explorer by querying:\\\\n+\\\\n+```https\\\\n+GET /v1.0/groups/{id}?$select=displayName,extension_<appIdNoHyphens>_GroupDN\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+### Convert Source of Authority (SOA)\\\\n+\\\\n+Once you have validated the DN is stored in the extension, you can convert the group’s Source of Authority to Microsoft Entra ID. This change makes the group cloud-managed while preserving its original DN in the extension for later use in group provisioning to AD DS.\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"d42a16cf86c9cf19ec4a424ab9976009521160fe\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/saas-apps/britive-provisioning-tutorial.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 9,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 9,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 18,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/0318bf778963f6e5fe5770726eeac88ef3d9213b/docs%2Fidentity%2Fsaas-apps%2Fbritive-provisioning-tutorial.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/0318bf778963f6e5fe5770726eeac88ef3d9213b/docs%2Fidentity%2Fsaas-apps%2Fbritive-provisioning-tutorial.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fsaas-apps%2Fbritive-provisioning-tutorial.md?ref=0318bf778963f6e5fe5770726eeac88ef3d9213b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -43,26 +43,26 @@ The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the followin\\\\n \\\\n ## Step 2: Configure Britive to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n \\\\n-The application has to be manually configured using the steps provided in the this section:\\\\n-1.

userimpact: Low\\\\n+# implementationcost: Medium\\\\n+---\\\\n+Without proper application management policies, threat actors can exploit weak or misconfigured application credentials to get unauthorized access to organizational resources. Applications using long-lived password secrets or certificates create extended attack windows where compromised credentials stay valid for extended periods. If an application uses client secrets that are hardcoded in configuration files or have weak password requirements, threat actors can extract these credentials through different means, including source code repositories, configuration dumps, or memory analysis.

Domain allow/deny lists operate at the tenant level and take precedence over Cross-Tenant Access Policies (XTAP), blocking invitations from domains on the deny list regardless of cross-tenant access settings. While XTAP enables granular controls for specific trusted tenants, domain restrictions are critical for preventing invitations from unknown or unverified domains that haven't been explicitly allowed.\\\\n+Limiting guest access to a known and approved list of tenants helps to prevent threat actors from exploiting unrestricted guest access to establish initial access through compromised external accounts or by creating accounts in untrusted tenants.

The synergy between these platforms empowers customers with enhanced security and seamless connectivity.\\\\n-\\\\n-This document contains steps to deploy these solutions side by side, specifically, Microsoft Entra Private Access (with Private DNS feature enabled) and Cisco Umbrella for internet access and DNS-layer security.\\\\n- \\\\n-## Configuration overview\\\\n-\\\\n-In Microsoft Entra, you enable the Private Access traffic forwarding profile and disable the Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles. You also enable and configure the Private DNS feature of Private Access. In Cisco, you capture Internet Access traffic.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The clients must be installed on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Microsoft Entra joined device or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Microsoft Entra Private Access configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Enable the Microsoft Entra Private Access traffic forwarding profile for your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information about enabling and disabling profiles, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Global Secure Access Client on end-user devices. For more information about clients, see [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md). To learn how to install the Windows client, see [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector. To learn how to install and configure the connector, see [How to configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Connector version v1.5.3829.0 or higher is required for Private DNS.\\\\n-\\\\n-Configure Quick Access to your private resources and set up Private DNS and DNS suffixes. To learn how to configure Quick Access, see [How to configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Cisco configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Add domain suffixes from Microsoft Entra Quick Access and Microsoft Entra service FQDN in Domain Management in Internal domains list to bypass Cisco’s Umbrella DNS. Add Microsoft Entra service FQDN and IPs in Domain Management in External domains list to bypass Cisco’s Secure Web Gateway (SWG).\\\\n-1. From Cisco Umbrella portal, go to **Deployments > Configuration > Domain Management**.\\\\n-1. In **Internal Domains** section, add these and save. \\\\n-    - `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com`.\\\\n-    - `<quickaccessapplicationid>.globalsecureaccess.local` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > `quickaccessapplicationid` is the application id of the quick access app you’ve configured.\\\\n-    - DNS suffixes you’ve configured in the Quick Access application.\\\\n-1. In the **External Domains & IPs** section, add these FQDN and IPs and save.\\\\n-    -  `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com, 150.171.19.0/24, 150.171.20.0/24, 13.107.232.0/24, 13.107.233.0/24, 150.171.15.0/24, 150.171.18.0/24, 151.206.0.0/16, 6.6.0.0/16`\\\\n-        > [!NOTE] \\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` for the FQDN.\\\\n-1. Restart Cisco Umbrella and Cisco SWG client services or restart the machine where the clients are installed.\\\\n-\\\\n-After both clients are installed and running side by side and configurations from admin portals are complete, go to the system tray to check that Global Secure Access and Cisco clients are enabled.\\\\n-\\\\n-Verify configuration for Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. Right click on the **Global Secure Access client > Advanced Diagnostics > Forwarding Profile** and verify that only Private Access rules are applied to this client.\\\\n-1. In **Advanced Diagnostics > Health Check** ensure no checks are failing.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Test traffic flow\\\\n-Microsoft’s SSE configuration: Enable Microsoft Entra Private Access, disable Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles.\\\\n-\\\\n-Cisco SSE configuration: Internet Access traffic is captured. The Private Access traffic is excluded.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client icon and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. Select the **Traffic** tab and select **Start collecting**.\\\\n-1. Access private resources you’ve configured with Entra Private Access such as SMB File share. Open `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\YourFileServer.yourdomain.com` by using the **Start/Run** menu from an explorer window.\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, select **Stop collecting**.\\\\n-1. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, scroll to observe the traffic generated to confirm that Private Access traffic was handled by the Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. You can also verify that the traffic is captured by Microsoft Entra by validating the traffic in the Global Secure Access traffic logs from Microsoft Entra admin center in **Global Secure Access > Monitor > Traffic logs**.\\\\n-1. Access any websites from the browsers and validate that internet traffic is missing from Global Secure Access traffic logs and only captured in Cisco Umbrella.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- [What is Global Secure Access?](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"56e606b753655d724005ad5566540e821d753ff9\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/concept-traffic-dashboard.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 12,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 5,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/de99cbaa320ee4985627c53d775eaf29df73a2e5/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fconcept-traffic-dashboard.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/de99cbaa320ee4985627c53d775eaf29df73a2e5/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fconcept-traffic-dashboard.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fconcept-traffic-dashboard.md?ref=de99cbaa320ee4985627c53d775eaf29df73a2e5\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -5,7 +5,7 @@ author: kenwith\\\\n ms.author: kenwith\\\\n manager: dougeby\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 07/29/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 10/07/2025\\\\n ms.service: global-secure-access\\\\n ai-usage: ai-assisted\\\\n ---\\\\n@@ -66,7 +66,7 @@ This widget provides the following alerts:\\\\n - **Unhealthy remote network**: An unhealthy remote network has one or more device links disconnected.\\\\n - **Increased external tenants activity**: The number of users accessing external tenants has increased.\\\\n - **Token and device inconsistency**: The original token is used on a different device.\\\\n-- **Web content blocked**: Access to the website has been blocked.\\\\n+- **Web content blocked**: Access to the website is blocked.\\\\n \\\\n ![Screenshot of the alerts and notifications widget showing two alert types.](media/concept-traffic-dashboard/dashboard-alerts-notifications.png)\\\\n \\\\n@@ -136,7 +136,7 @@ Select **View all web categories** to view more details about your network traff\\\\n \\\\n ## Device status\\\\n \\\\n-The **Device status** widgets display the active and inactive devices that you have deployed.\\\\n+The **Device status** widgets display the active and inactive devices that you deployed.\\\\n \\\\n - **Active devices**: The number of distinct device IDs seen in the last 24 hours and the % change during that time.\\\\n - **Inactive devices**: The number of distinct device IDs that were seen in the last seven days, but not during the last 24 hours.

Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access offer complementary Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) capabilities. When integrated, these platforms enhance security and connectivity for diverse access scenarios.\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide outlines how to configure and deploy Global Secure Access solutions alongside Cisco Secure Access SSE offerings. By using both platforms, you can optimize your organization's security posture while maintaining high-performance connectivity for private applications, Microsoft 365 traffic, and internet access.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Scenarios\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide covers the following coexistence scenarios:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access](#1-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access).**\\\\n+In this scenario, Global Secure Access handles private application traffic. Cisco Secure Internet Access provides DNS security and SWG capabilities.\\\\n+\\\\n+2.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#2-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+In this scenario, both clients handle traffic for separate private applications. Global Secure Access handles private applications in Microsoft Entra Private Access, while the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.\\\\n+\\\\n+3.  **[Microsoft Entra Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#3-microsoft-entra-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+Global Secure Access manages all Microsoft 365 traffic. The Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.\\\\n+\\\\n+4.  **[Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Private Access](#4-microsoft-entra-internet-access-and-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+Global Secure Access manages internet and Microsoft traffic. Cisco Secure Access handles only Private Access with the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module.\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+To configure Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access for a unified SASE solution:\\\\n+\\\\n+- Set up Global Secure Access (Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access).\\\\n+- Configure Cisco Secure Internet Access and Secure Private Access.\\\\n+- Establish required FQDN and IP bypasses for integration between the platforms.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Global Secure Access setup\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Enable and disable different traffic forwarding profiles** for your Microsoft Entra tenant. See [Traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).\\\\n+1. **Install and configure the private network connector** for Private Access applications. See [Configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n+1. **Configure Quick Access** to private resources and set up private DNS and DNS suffixes. See [Configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).\\\\n+1. **Install and configure the Global Secure Access client** on end-user devices. See [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> Private Network Connectors are required for Private Access applications.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Cisco Secure Access setup\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Set up a resource connector** for private applications. See Cisco documentation for [managing resource connectors and connector groups](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manage-resource-connectors-and-connector-groups).\\\\n+1. **Provision users and groups**. Integration with Microsoft Entra ID provides the best user experience. See Cisco documentation for [Microsoft Entra ID SAML configuration](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/configure-azure-for-saml).\\\\n+1. **Add private resources and create access policies**. See Cisco documentation for [managing private access rules](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manage-private-access-rules).\\\\n+1. **Set up internet security and configure bypasses** for coexistence.

The synergy between these platforms empowers customers with enhanced security and seamless connectivity.\\\\n-\\\\n-This document contains steps to deploy these solutions side by side, specifically, Microsoft Entra Private Access (with Private DNS feature enabled) and Cisco Umbrella for internet access and DNS-layer security.\\\\n- \\\\n-## Configuration overview\\\\n-\\\\n-In Microsoft Entra, you enable the Private Access traffic forwarding profile and disable the Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles. You also enable and configure the Private DNS feature of Private Access. In Cisco, you capture Internet Access traffic.\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The clients must be installed on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Microsoft Entra joined device or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Microsoft Entra Private Access configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Enable the Microsoft Entra Private Access traffic forwarding profile for your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information about enabling and disabling profiles, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Global Secure Access Client on end-user devices. For more information about clients, see [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md). To learn how to install the Windows client, see [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md). \\\\n-\\\\n-Install and configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector. To learn how to install and configure the connector, see [How to configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-> [!NOTE]\\\\n-> Connector version v1.5.3829.0 or higher is required for Private DNS.\\\\n-\\\\n-Configure Quick Access to your private resources and set up Private DNS and DNS suffixes. To learn how to configure Quick Access, see [How to configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-## Cisco configuration\\\\n-\\\\n-Add domain suffixes from Microsoft Entra Quick Access and Microsoft Entra service FQDN in Domain Management in Internal domains list to bypass Cisco’s Umbrella DNS. Add Microsoft Entra service FQDN and IPs in Domain Management in External domains list to bypass Cisco’s Secure Web Gateway (SWG).\\\\n-1. From Cisco Umbrella portal, go to **Deployments > Configuration > Domain Management**.\\\\n-1. In **Internal Domains** section, add these and save. \\\\n-    - `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com`.\\\\n-    - `<quickaccessapplicationid>.globalsecureaccess.local` \\\\n-        > [!NOTE]\\\\n-        > `quickaccessapplicationid` is the application id of the quick access app you’ve configured.\\\\n-    - DNS suffixes you’ve configured in the Quick Access application.\\\\n-1. In the **External Domains & IPs** section, add these FQDN and IPs and save.\\\\n-    -  `*.globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com, 150.171.19.0/24, 150.171.20.0/24, 13.107.232.0/24, 13.107.233.0/24, 150.171.15.0/24, 150.171.18.0/24, 151.206.0.0/16, 6.6.0.0/16`\\\\n-        > [!NOTE] \\\\n-        > Cisco Umbrella has an implied wildcard, so you can use `globalsecureaccess.microsoft.com` for the FQDN.\\\\n-1. Restart Cisco Umbrella and Cisco SWG client services or restart the machine where the clients are installed.\\\\n-\\\\n-After both clients are installed and running side by side and configurations from admin portals are complete, go to the system tray to check that Global Secure Access and Cisco clients are enabled.\\\\n-\\\\n-Verify configuration for Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. Right click on the **Global Secure Access client > Advanced Diagnostics > Forwarding Profile** and verify that only Private Access rules are applied to this client.\\\\n-1. In **Advanced Diagnostics > Health Check** ensure no checks are failing.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Test traffic flow\\\\n-Microsoft’s SSE configuration: Enable Microsoft Entra Private Access, disable Internet Access and Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profiles.\\\\n-\\\\n-Cisco SSE configuration: Internet Access traffic is captured. The Private Access traffic is excluded.\\\\n-\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client icon and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. Select the **Traffic** tab and select **Start collecting**.\\\\n-1. Access private resources you’ve configured with Entra Private Access such as SMB File share. Open `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\YourFileServer.yourdomain.com` by using the **Start/Run** menu from an explorer window.\\\\n-1. In the system tray, right-click the Global Secure Access client and then select **Advanced Diagnostics**. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, select **Stop collecting**.\\\\n-1. In the **Network traffic** dialog box, scroll to observe the traffic generated to confirm that Private Access traffic was handled by the Global Secure Access client.\\\\n-1. You can also verify that the traffic is captured by Microsoft Entra by validating the traffic in the Global Secure Access traffic logs from Microsoft Entra admin center in **Global Secure Access > Monitor > Traffic logs**.\\\\n-1. Access any websites from the browsers and validate that internet traffic is missing from Global Secure Access traffic logs and only captured in Cisco Umbrella.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Next steps\\\\n-\\\\n-- [What is Global Secure Access?](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"441c51a33c992504ab65b994b4121c1d9527e20d\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/global-secure-access/how-to-cisco-coexistence.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 166,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 166,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/eeebdfd03a4004aa9092dc0d6192b6bb8a51cbda/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-cisco-coexistence.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/eeebdfd03a4004aa9092dc0d6192b6bb8a51cbda/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-cisco-coexistence.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fglobal-secure-access%2Fhow-to-cisco-coexistence.md?ref=eeebdfd03a4004aa9092dc0d6192b6bb8a51cbda\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,166 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Security Service Edge (SSE) Coexistence With Microsoft and Cisco Umbrella\\\\n+description: Microsoft and Cisco’s Security Service Edge (SSE) coexistence solution guide.\\\\n+author: kenwith\\\\n+ms.author: kenwith\\\\n+manager: dougeby\\\\n+ms.topic: conceptual\\\\n+ms.date: 10/06/2025\\\\n+ms.service: global-secure-access\\\\n+ms.subservice: entra-private-access \\\\n+ms.reviewer: shkhalid\\\\n+ai-usage: ai-assisted\\\\n+---\\\\n+\\\\n+# Security Service Edge (SSE) coexistence with Microsoft and Cisco Umbrella DNS protection\\\\n+\\\\n+Learn how to deploy Global Secure Access and Cisco Umbrella, with DNS security only, in a unified environment.

Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access offer complementary Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) capabilities. When integrated, these platforms enhance security and connectivity for diverse access scenarios.\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide outlines how to configure and deploy Global Secure Access solutions alongside Cisco Secure Access SSE offerings. By using both platforms, you can optimize your organization's security posture while maintaining high-performance connectivity for private applications, Microsoft 365 traffic, and internet access.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Scenarios\\\\n+\\\\n+This guide covers the following coexistence scenarios:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access](#1-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access).**\\\\n+In this scenario, Global Secure Access handles private application traffic. Cisco Secure Internet Access provides DNS security and SWG capabilities.\\\\n+\\\\n+2.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#2-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+In this scenario, both clients handle traffic for separate private applications. Global Secure Access handles private applications in Microsoft Entra Private Access, while the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.\\\\n+\\\\n+3.  **[Microsoft Entra Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#3-microsoft-entra-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+Global Secure Access manages all Microsoft 365 traffic. The Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.\\\\n+\\\\n+4.  **[Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Private Access](#4-microsoft-entra-internet-access-and-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-private-access).**\\\\n+Global Secure Access manages internet and Microsoft traffic. Cisco Secure Access handles only Private Access with the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module.\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+To configure Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access for a unified SASE solution:\\\\n+\\\\n+- Set up Global Secure Access (Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access).\\\\n+- Configure Cisco Secure Internet Access and Secure Private Access.\\\\n+- Establish required FQDN and IP bypasses for integration between the platforms.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Global Secure Access setup\\\\n+\\\\n+1. **Enable and disable different traffic forwarding profiles** for your Microsoft Entra tenant.

These providers offer comprehensive fraud protection solutions that enable organizations to detect and block automated attacks, such as bot-driven registrations, during the user sign-up process.  \\\\n+\\\\n+By integrating Arkose Labs, HUMAN, or both with Microsoft Entra External ID, you can leverage their advanced risk assessment capabilities to ensure that only legitimate users create accounts.  \\\\n+\\\\n+This article explains how to integrate fraud protection providers with Microsoft Entra External ID.\\\\n+\\\\n+::: zone pivot=\\\\\\\"arkose\\\\\\\"\\\\n+\\\\n+## How Arkose Labs works\\\\n+\\\\n+When a user attempts to sign up, the Arkose Labs service evaluates the request and determines if it's likely to be fraudulent. If the request is flagged as suspicious, the user is presented with a challenge (like a CAPTCHA) to verify that they're human. If the user successfully completes the challenge, they can proceed with the sign-up process. Once this feature is enabled, you'll be able to view Arkose challenge metrics in the Arkose Labs dashboard. Additionally, you can fine-tune risk policies by coordinating with Arkose Labs support.\\\\n+\\\\n+You can complete the integration in both the Microsoft Entra admin center and the Microsoft Graph API.

To address this, Entra External ID supports integration with third-party fraud detection providers such as HUMAN Security. This integration enables real-time analysis of sign-up attempts, leveraging HUMAN Security’s advanced detection algorithms to identify and block suspicious activity before account creation is completed. The solution is natively integrated with Microsoft identity infrastructure, allowing for streamlined deployment and management. By implementing this approach, organizations can access detailed telemetry and actionable insights to monitor sign-up flows, fine-tune detection thresholds, and respond proactively to emerging threats, thereby maintaining the integrity of their user base.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- An [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).\\\\n+- A [registered application](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) in the tenant.\\\\n+- An account with at least an [Authentication Extensibility Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-extensibility-administrator) or [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) role in the external tenant.\\\\n+- Create a HUMAN Security account: Contact Human Security (entra@humansecurity.com) to create and set up a free HUMAN Security account. \\\\n+- The following configuration values from HUMAN Security:\\\\n+  - Application ID\\\\n+  - Server token\\\\n+\\\\n+You can find these values in the HUMAN Security admin console in the [application settings](https://docs.humansecurity.com/applications-and-accounts/docs/managing-applications#adding-server-tokens) page. If you're unsure about any value, contact HUMAN Security for assistance.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Configure HUMAN Security in the Microsoft Entra admin center\\\\n+\\\\n+To integrate HUMAN Security with Microsoft Entra External ID, you can use the Service Integration wizard in Microsoft Entra admin center to create a fraud protection provider policy.  \\\\n+\\\\n+1.

If you see a trend like this, check to ensure that none of the objects required for access were deleted.\\\\n \\\\n ## Soft deletions\\\\n \\\\n-When objects such as users, Microsoft 365 Groups, or application registrations are soft deleted, they enter a suspended state in which they aren't available for use by other services. In this state, items retain their properties and can be restored for 30 days. After 30 days, objects in the soft-deleted state are permanently, or hard, deleted.\\\\n+When objects such as users, Microsoft 365 Groups, or application registrations are soft deleted, they enter a suspended state in which they aren't available for use by other services.

The update provides a comprehensive set of solutions, including modifying the HOSTS file, checking Group Policy or MDM settings for the DNS Client's `PrimaryDnsSuffix`, and crucially, instructs how to correctly set the \"Primary DNS Suffix\" on the target machine to align the FQDN with the Azure AD device record, thereby resolving the connection problem.",

barclayn\\\\n-# Customer intent: As a developer, I'm looking for information about the open standards that are supported by Microsoft Entra Verified ID.\\\\n----\\\\n-\\\\n-# Configure Verified ID by AU10TIX as your Identity Verification Partner\\\\n-\\\\n-In this article, we cover the steps needed to integrate Microsoft Entra Verified ID with [AU10TIX](https://www.au10tix.com/). AU10TIX is an automated solution for the verification of ID documents + biometrics. AU10TIX supports the verification of documents in over 190 regions reading documents in their regional languages.\\\\n-\\\\n-To learn more about AU10TIX and its complete set of solutions, visit https://www.au10tix.com/.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Prerequisites\\\\n-\\\\n- You need to meet the following requirements before you can continue with the steps in this article:\\\\n-\\\\n-- A tenant [configured](verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant.md) for Microsoft Entra Verified ID service.\\\\n-    - If you don't have an existing tenant, you can [create an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).\\\\n-- You first need to complete the onboarding process with Au10tix.\\\\n-    - To create a AU10TIX account, submit the form on this [page](https://www.au10tix.com/solutions/verifiable-credentials/).\\\\n-\\\\n-\\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> Before you proceed, you must have a URL from Au10Tix for users to be issued Verified IDs. If you don't have it, follow up with Au10Tix before you attempt to follow the steps in this article.\\\\n-\\\\n-## Scenario description\\\\n-\\\\n-When onboarding users you can remove the need for error prone manual onboarding steps by using Verified ID with A10TIX account onboarding. Verified IDs can be used to digitally onboard employees, students, citizens, or others to securely access resources and services. For example, rather than an employee needing to go to a central office to activate an employee badge, they can use a Verified ID to verify their identity to activate a badge that is delivered to them remotely. Rather than a citizen receiving a code they must redeem to access governmental services, they can use a Verified ID to prove their identity and gain access.

To request Verified IDs from your users, include the request URL and body in your application or website. \\\\n-   >[!Note]\\\\n-   >If you are using [one of the sample apps](https://aka.ms/vcsample), you'll need to replace the contents of the `presentation_request_config.json` with the request body obtained in [Part 1](#part-1). The sample code overwrites the `trustedIssuers` values with `IssuerAuthority` value from `appsettings.json`. Copy the `trustedIssuers` value from the payload to `IssuerAuthority` in `appsettings.json` file.\\\\n-1.

They're simple to deploy and maintain, and powerful. This article explains what connectors are, how they work, and how to optimize your deployment.\\\\n \\\\n ## What is a private network connector?\\\\n \\\\n-Connectors are lightweight agents that sit in a private network and facilitate the outbound connection to the Microsoft Entra Private Access and application proxy services. Connectors must be installed on a Windows Server that has access to the backend resources. You can organize connectors into connector groups, with each group handling traffic to specific resources. For more information on application proxy and a diagrammatic representation of application proxy architecture, see [Using Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md).\\\\n+Private network connectors are lightweight agents you install on a Windows Server inside your network. They create outbound connections to Microsoft Entra Private Access and the application proxy service to reach backend resources. Organize connectors into connector groups that handle traffic for specific resources. For an architecture overview, see [Using Microsoft Entra application proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md). To set them up, see [How to configure private network connectors for Microsoft Entra Private Access](how-to-configure-connectors.md). Users connect to the cloud service, which routes traffic to apps through the connectors.\\\\n \\\\n+Set up and register a connector with the application proxy service:\\\\n+1. Open outbound ports 80 and 443 and allow access to the required service and Microsoft Entra ID URLs.\\\\n+1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center and run the installer on an on-premises Windows Server.\\\\n+1. Start the connector so it listens to the application proxy service.\\\\n+1. Add the on-premises application to Microsoft Entra ID and set the user-facing URLs.\\\\n \\\\n-To learn how to configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector, see [How to configure private network connectors for Microsoft Entra Private Access](how-to-configure-connectors.md).\\\\n-\\\\n-Private network connectors are lightweight agents deployed on-premises that facilitate the outbound connection to the application proxy service in the cloud. The connectors must be installed on a Windows Server that has access to the backend application. Users connect to the application proxy cloud service that routes their traffic to the apps via the connectors.\\\\n-\\\\n-Setup and registration between a connector and the application proxy service is accomplished as follows:\\\\n-\\\\n-1. The IT administrator opens ports 80 and 443 to outbound traffic and allows access to several URLs that are needed by the connector, the application proxy service, and Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n-2. The admin signs into the Microsoft Entra admin center and runs an executable to install the connector on an on-premises Windows server.\\\\n-3. The connector starts to \\\\\\\"listen\\\\\\\" to the application proxy service.\\\\n-4. The admin adds the on-premises application to Microsoft Entra ID and configures settings such as the URLs users need to connect to their apps.\\\\n-\\\\n-It's recommended that you always deploy multiple connectors for redundancy and scale. The connectors, in conjunction with the service, take care of all the high availability tasks and can be added or removed dynamically. Each time a new request arrives it's routed to one of the connectors that is available. When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. If a connector is temporarily unavailable, it doesn't respond to this traffic. Unused connectors are tagged as inactive and removed after 10 days of inactivity.\\\\n+Deploy at least two connectors for redundancy and scale. The service and connectors handle high availability, and you can add or remove connectors at any time. Each request routes to an available connector. If a connector is unavailable, it doesn't handle traffic. The service tags unused connectors as inactive and removes them after 10 days of inactivity.\\\\n \\\\n > [!NOTE]\\\\n > You can monitor the [version history page](reference-version-history.md) to stay informed on the latest updates so that you can schedule appropriate connector upgrades.\\\\n \\\\n-Each private network connector is assigned to a [connector group](concept-connector-groups.md). Connectors in the same connector group act as a single unit for high availability and load balancing. You can create new groups, assign connectors to them in the Microsoft Entra admin center, then assign specific connectors to serve specific applications.

If one is found, the connectors update themselves.\\\\n+Connectors poll the service for updates. When a newer version is available, they update themselves.\\\\n \\\\n-You can monitor your connectors from the machine they're running on, using either the event log and performance counters. You can also view their status in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For Microsoft Entra Private Access, navigate to Global Secure Access, Connect, and select Connectors. For application proxy, navigate to Identity, Applications, Enterprise applications, and select the application. On the application page select application proxy.\\\\n+Monitor connectors on the host machine by using the event log and performance counters. View status in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

When a connector is running, it remains active as it connects to the service. Unused connectors are tagged as `_inactive_` and are removed after 10 days of inactivity. If you do want to uninstall a connector, though, uninstall both the Connector service and the Updater service from the server. Restart the computer to fully remove the service.\\\\n+You don't need to delete unused connectors manually. The service tags inactive connectors `_inactive_` and removes them after 10 days.

If your CPU or memory utilization is above the suggested maximum, you may want to consider adding more connectors to distribute your workloads effectively. \\\\n+Keep peak CPU and memory utilization per connector under 70%. If sustained utilization exceeds 70%, add connectors to the group or scale up host capacity to distribute load. Monitor with Windows performance counters to validate that utilization returns to an acceptable range.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Throughput:** \\\\n-Each connector, configured with the above specifications, can support up to 1.5 Gbps throughput over TCP on an Azure VM. Throughput is measured as the total of both inbound and outbound traffic. Higher throughput can be achieved by running the connector on VMs with increased memory, CPU resources, and enhanced network link speeds.\\\\n+Up to ~1.5 Gbps aggregate TCP throughput (combined inbound + outbound) per connector on an Azure VM sized at 4 vCPU / 8 GiB RAM with standard networking. Higher throughput can be achieved by using larger VM sizes (more vCPUs, memory, accelerated/high-bandwidth NICs) or by adding more connectors in the same group to scale out.\\\\n \\\\n-**Additional Details:**  \\\\n-- Sizing recommendations made above are based on performance testing done on a test tenant using iPerf3 tool with TCP data streams. Actual performance can vary under different testing environments. More details on specific test cases will be published as part of this documentation in coming months. \\\\n+**More details:**  \\\\n+- Performance guidance (for example ~1.5 Gbps on a 4 vCPU / 8 GiB host) is derived from controlled lab tests using iPerf3 TCP data streams in a dedicated test tenant. Actual throughput can vary based on CPU generation, NIC capabilities (accelerated networking, offloads), TLS cipher suites, network latency and jitter, packet loss, concurrent protocol mix (HTTP(S), SMB, RDP), intermediate devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS, SSL inspection), and backend application responsiveness. Scenario-based benchmark data (mixed workloads, high-connection concurrency, latency-sensitive applications) will be added to this documentation as it becomes available.\\\\n - Once a connector is enrolled, it establishes outbound TLS tunnels to the Private Access cloud infrastructure. These tunnels handle all data path traffic. In addition, we have some control plane channel, driving keep-alive heartbeat, health reporting, connector upgrades and so on utilizing minimal bandwidth.\\\\n-- You can deploy additional connectors within the same connector group to increase overall throughput, provided adequate network and internet connectivity is available.

You want to keep as much traffic within a specific datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. You deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the applications that reside within the datacenter. This approach minimizes cross-datacenter links and provides an entirely transparent experience to your users.\\\\n+Large organizations use multiple datacenters. Keep as much traffic in a datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. Deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the apps in that datacenter. This approach reduces cross-datacenter traffic and is transparent to users.\\\\n \\\\n ### Applications installed on isolated networks\\\\n \\\\n-Applications can be hosted in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. You can use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks to also isolate applications to the network. The scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific application.\\\\n+Apps run in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. Use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks and keep those apps contained there. This scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific app.\\\\n \\\\n-### Applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\\\n+### Applications installed on infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\\\\n \\\\n-For applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud access, connector groups provide a common service to secure access to all apps. Connector groups don't create more dependencies on your corporate network, or fragment the app experience. Connectors are installed on every cloud datacenter and serve only applications that reside in that network. You install several connectors to achieve high availability.\\\\n+For apps on infrastructure as a service (IaaS), use connector groups to secure access to all apps without adding corporate network dependencies or fragmenting the experience. Install connectors in each cloud datacenter and scope them to apps in that network. Install multiple connectors for high availability.\\\\n \\\\n-Take as an example an organization that has several virtual machines connected to their own IaaS hosted virtual network. To allow employees to use these applications, these private networks are connected to the corporate network using site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Site-to-site VPN provides a good experience for employees that are located on-premises. But, it isn't ideal for remote employees, because it requires more on-premises infrastructure to route access, as illustrated in the diagram:\\\\n+For example, an organization has several virtual machines connected to its own IaaS-hosted virtual network.

The connector’s machines are joined to a domain that can delegate the users to the application. KCD supports cross-forest capabilities. But for companies who have distinct multi-forest environments with no trust between them, a single connector can't be used for all forests. Instead, specific connectors are deployed per forest, and set to serve applications that are published to serve only the users of that specific forest. Each connector group represents a different forest. While the tenant and most of the experience is unified for all forests, users can be assigned to their forest applications using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n+Single sign-on often uses Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).

Deploy dedicated connectors per forest and scope them to apps for users in that forest. Each connector group represents a forest. The tenant and most of the experience are unified, and you assign users to their forest apps by using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n \\\\n-### Disaster Recovery sites\\\\n+### Disaster recovery sites\\\\n \\\\n There are two approaches to consider for disaster recovery (DR) sites:\\\\n \\\\n-* Your DR site is built in active-active mode where it's exactly like the main site. The site also has the same networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. You can create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers for you.\\\\n-* Your DR site is separate from the main site. You create a different connector group in the DR site. You either have backup applications, or manually divert existing application to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n+* Your DR site runs in active-active mode and matches the main site networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. Create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers.\\\\n+* Your DR site is separate from the main site. Create a different connector group there. Use backup apps or manually divert existing apps to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n \\\\n ### Serve multiple companies from a single tenant\\\\n \\\\n-You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies. Connector groups help you segregate the connectors and applications into different groups. One way, which is suitable for small companies, is to have a single Microsoft Entra tenant while the different companies have their own domain name and networks. The same approach works for merger scenarios and situations where a single division serves several companies for regulatory or business reasons.\\\\n+You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies.

All applications are served using customized connector groups.\\\\n+For large, complex organizations, set the default connector group to hold idle or newly installed connectors. Don’t assign applications to it.

These versions contain a back-end service change that hardens our services and readies Connect Sync for the [MSOnline PowerShell retirement](https://aka.ms/msonlineretirement) in April 2025. **All customers are required to upgrade** to the [minimum versions](#minimum-versions) by **April 30, 2025**.\\\\n \\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n->**All customers are required to upgrade** to the [minimum versions](#minimum-versions) by **April 30, 2025**.\\\\n+#customer intent: As an IT admin, I want to know the minimum version requirements for Microsoft Entra Connect Sync so that I can ensure compliance.\\\\n+---\\\\n+# Hardening update to Microsoft Entra Connect Sync\\\\n \\\\n-The deadline has been extended by three weeks from the earlier communicated date of April 7, 2025.\\\\n+As part of increasing the security posture of Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft deployed a dedicated first-party application to enable the synchronization between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. This new application will manifest as a first party service principal called the \\\\\\\"Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service\\\\\\\" (Application Id: `6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016`) and will be visible in the Enterprise Applications experience within the Microsoft Entra admin center. This application is critical for the continued operation of on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID synchronization functionality through Entra Connect.\\\\n \\\\n+We have since released a new version (2.5.79.0) of Microsoft Entra Connect that contains this service change.  All customers are required to upgrade to the minimum versions by September 30, 2026 to avoid service disruptions.\\\\n \\\\n ## Expected impacts \\\\n \\\\n-Though the deadline has been extended, if you are not yet on a minimum supported version, you'll experience the following impacts after the original date:\\\\n-\\\\n-- After April 7, 2025, configuration of Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) scenarios through Microsoft Entra Connect wizard won't work.\\\\n- - After April 7, 2025, configuration of PingFederate scenarios through the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard won't work.\\\\n- - After April 30, 2025, all authentication requests to Microsoft Entra ID on the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard will fail. Some of the capabilities that will be impacted include schema refresh, configuration of staging mode and user sign-in changes.\\\\n-\\\\n-For example, when calling the MSOnline PowerShell cmdlet `Get-MsolUserRole`, Microsoft Entra Connect wizard throws an error: _\\\\\\\"Access Denied. You do not have permissions to call this cmdlet\\\\\\\"_\\\\n-\\\\n-![Screenshot that shows MSOnline PowerShell error in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync wizard.](media/harden-update-ad-fs-pingfederate/msonline-connect-wizard-error.png)\\\\n-\\\\n+If you aren’t upgraded to the minimum required version (2.5.79.0), you might encounter the following impact to the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync service when the service change takes effect:\\\\n \\\\n-## What won't be impacted\\\\n-\\\\n-- Your sync service will run as usual, and changes will continue to sync to Microsoft Entra.\\\\n- - The ability to upgrade your Microsoft Entra Connect Sync instance. You can still perform the upgrade after April 30, 2025.\\\\n-   \\\\n->[!NOTE]\\\\n->If you're unable to upgrade by the deadline, you can still restore the impacted functionalities by upgrading to the [latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594). You will, however, lose the ability to **make changes on the Entra Connect Sync wizard that require user sign in with the Entra ID credentials** during the time period between **April 30, 2025 and when you upgrade**.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Minimum versions \\\\n-\\\\n-To avoid service impacts, customers should be on version by April 30, 2025. \\\\n-- Customers in commercial clouds: [2.4.18.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#24180) or any newer version (see [version history](reference-connect-version-history.md)\\\\\\\\)\\\\n-- Customers in noncommercial clouds: [2.4.21.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#24210) or any newer version (see [version history](reference-connect-version-history.md))\\\\n-\\\\n-To upgrade to the latest version.\\\\n-> [!div class=\\\\\\\"nextstepaction\\\\\\\"]\\\\n-> [Install the latest Microsoft Entra Connect Sync](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594)\\\\n-\\\\n->[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> Make sure you familiarize yourself with the [minimum requirements](how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md) for the versions, including but not limited to: \\\\n->  - [.NET 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472#:~:text=Downloads%20for%20building%20and%20running%20applications%20with%20.NET%20Framework%204.7.2)\\\\n-\\\\n-To assist customers with the upgrade process, we perform autoupgrades for select releases, which can help streamline the upgrade process for you. If you would like to be autoupgraded, ensure you have the [autoupgrade feature](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md) configured. For [autoupgrade to work](security-updates-pks.md), ensure that you meet the [minimum requirements](how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md#auto-upgrade-eligibility) for autoupgrade. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Workaround for enabling Staging mode post MSOnline retirement\\\\n-\\\\n-Post the MSOnline retirement date, older versions of Microsoft Entra Connect can’t switch Staging mode via the wizard.\\\\n-\\\\n-You can safely proceed with the in-place upgrade to fully restore Microsoft Entra Connect functionally, but in case you want to enable Staging mode prior to upgrade your server, the following workaround via PowerShell is available.\\\\n+All synchronization services in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync will fail.\\\\n \\\\n > [!NOTE]\\\\n-> The following cmdlet is not supported in PowerShell 7 and only works on older Microsoft Entra Connect versions that have MSOnline module dependencies.\\\\n+> If you’re unable to upgrade by the deadline, you can restore the impacted functionalities by upgrading to the latest version.

Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is the new sync client that works from the cloud and allows customers to set up and manage their sync preferences online. We recommend that you use Cloud Sync because we're introducing new features that improve the sync experiences through Cloud Sync. You can avoid future migrations by choosing Cloud Sync if that's the right option for you. Use the https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions to see if Cloud Sync is the right sync client for you. \\\\n \\\\n-See the video below to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.\\\\n+See the following video to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.\\\\n \\\\n > [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/9T6lKEloq0Q]\\\\n \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"42407c4d30124f95d445e8d9277ebcef08150eed\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 6,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 7,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fhybrid%2Fconnect%2Fhow-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md?ref=3a1573f51d555e3e78b82b2ef01b3fc537e382e7\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -8,13 +8,18 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.tgt_pltfrm: na\\\\n ms.custom: no-azure-ad-ps-ref, sfi-ga-nochange\\\\n ms.topic: how-to\\\\n-ms.date: 08/28/2025\\\\n+ms.date: 09/17/2025\\\\n ms.subservice: hybrid-connect\\\\n ms.author: jomondi\\\\n ---\\\\n # Prerequisites for Microsoft Entra Connect\\\\n This article describes the prerequisites and the hardware requirements for Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n \\\\n+>[!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+>**Mandatory Upgrade Required**: All synchronization services in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync will stop working on **September 30, 2026** if you're not on at least version 2.5.79.0.

You want to keep as much traffic within a specific datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. You deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the applications that reside within the datacenter. This approach minimizes cross-datacenter links and provides an entirely transparent experience to your users.\\\\n+Large organizations use multiple datacenters. Keep as much traffic in a datacenter as possible because cross-datacenter links are expensive and slow. Deploy connectors in each datacenter to serve only the apps in that datacenter. This approach reduces cross-datacenter traffic and is transparent to users.\\\\n \\\\n ### Applications installed on isolated networks\\\\n \\\\n-Applications can be hosted in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. You can use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks to also isolate applications to the network. The scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific application.\\\\n+Apps run in networks that aren't part of the main corporate network. Use connector groups to install dedicated connectors on isolated networks and keep those apps contained there. This scenario is common for vendors that maintain a specific app.\\\\n \\\\n-### Applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\\\n+### Applications installed on infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\\\\n \\\\n-For applications installed on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for cloud access, connector groups provide a common service to secure access to all apps. Connector groups don't create more dependencies on your corporate network, or fragment the app experience. Connectors are installed on every cloud datacenter and serve only applications that reside in that network. You install several connectors to achieve high availability.\\\\n+For apps on infrastructure as a service (IaaS), use connector groups to secure access to all apps without adding corporate network dependencies or fragmenting the experience. Install connectors in each cloud datacenter and scope them to apps in that network. Install multiple connectors for high availability.\\\\n \\\\n-Take as an example an organization that has several virtual machines connected to their own IaaS hosted virtual network. To allow employees to use these applications, these private networks are connected to the corporate network using site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Site-to-site VPN provides a good experience for employees that are located on-premises. But, it isn't ideal for remote employees, because it requires more on-premises infrastructure to route access, as illustrated in the diagram:\\\\n+For example, an organization has several virtual machines connected to its own IaaS-hosted virtual network.

The connector’s machines are joined to a domain that can delegate the users to the application. KCD supports cross-forest capabilities. But for companies who have distinct multi-forest environments with no trust between them, a single connector can't be used for all forests. Instead, specific connectors are deployed per forest, and set to serve applications that are published to serve only the users of that specific forest. Each connector group represents a different forest. While the tenant and most of the experience is unified for all forests, users can be assigned to their forest applications using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n+Single sign-on often uses Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).

Deploy dedicated connectors per forest and scope them to apps for users in that forest. Each connector group represents a forest. The tenant and most of the experience are unified, and you assign users to their forest apps by using Microsoft Entra groups.\\\\n \\\\n-### Disaster Recovery sites\\\\n+### Disaster recovery sites\\\\n \\\\n There are two approaches to consider for disaster recovery (DR) sites:\\\\n \\\\n-* Your DR site is built in active-active mode where it's exactly like the main site. The site also has the same networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. You can create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers for you.\\\\n-* Your DR site is separate from the main site. You create a different connector group in the DR site. You either have backup applications, or manually divert existing application to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n+* Your DR site runs in active-active mode and matches the main site networking and Active Directory (AD) settings. Create the connectors on the DR site in the same connector group as the main site. Microsoft Entra ID detects failovers.\\\\n+* Your DR site is separate from the main site. Create a different connector group there. Use backup apps or manually divert existing apps to the DR connector group as needed.\\\\n \\\\n ### Serve multiple companies from a single tenant\\\\n \\\\n-You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies. Connector groups help you segregate the connectors and applications into different groups. One way, which is suitable for small companies, is to have a single Microsoft Entra tenant while the different companies have their own domain name and networks. The same approach works for merger scenarios and situations where a single division serves several companies for regulatory or business reasons.\\\\n+You can implement a model in which a single service provider deploys and maintains Microsoft Entra related services for multiple companies.

Don’t assign applications to it.

The document's modification date has also been updated.\n*   **FIDO2 Compatibility:** The \"concept-fido2-compatibility.md\" document has had its modification date updated and a reviewer changed. Additionally, it clarifies that BLE and NFC security keys are not supported on Android by Google, and security key registration with Microsoft Entra ID is also not supported on Android.\n*   **Conditional Access Agent Optimization:** Two documents related to Conditional Access agent optimization have been updated. \"agent-optimization-review-suggestions.md\" has had its title changed from \"Review policy reports (Preview)\" to \"Review policy reports\" and a minor wording adjustment. \"howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md\" has seen its modification date updated, a reviewer updated, and the prerequisites for using the insights and reporting workbook clarified to include access to the Log Analytics workspace, along with appropriate permissions for both the security reader role and the workspace.",

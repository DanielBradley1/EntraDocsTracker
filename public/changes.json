Each application can have its own theme that you can customize with a background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. This customization overrides any configurations made to the default branding. If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements are displayed.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article describes how you can create multiple branding themes for different applications in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Have at least the [Organizational Branding Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator) role.\\\\n+- Have at least the [Application Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role for applications that you want to apply a theme to.\\\\n+- A registered application in your tenant. If you haven't registered an application yet, see [Register an application](../../identity-platform/quickstart-register-app.md).\\\\n+- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Branding theme properties\\\\n+\\\\n+When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the sign-in page, with each of the default branding elements highlighted.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+| Property | Description |\\\\n+| --- | --- |\\\\n+| Favicon | Small icon that appears on the left side of the browser tab. |\\\\n+| Header | Space across the top of the sign-in page, behind the header log. |\\\\n+| Header logo | Logo that appears in the upper-left corner of the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Background image | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Page background color | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Banner logo | Logo that appears at the top of the sign-in box |\\\\n+| Sign-in page title | Larger text that appears below the banner logo. |\\\\n+| Sign-in page description | Text to describe the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Username hint and text | The text that appears before a user enters their information. |\\\\n+| Sign-in display message box | Text you can add below the username field. |\\\\n+| Footer link: Privacy & Cookies | Link you can add to the lower-right corner for privacy information. |\\\\n+| Footer: Terms of Use | Text in the lower-right corner of the page where you can add Terms of use information. |\\\\n+| Footer | Space across the bottom of the page for privacy and Terms of Use information. |\\\\n+| Template | The layout of the page and sign-in boxes. |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How branding themes work\\\\n+\\\\n+Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.\\\\n+- **Default branding (company branding)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.\\\\n+- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.\\\\n+- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.\\\\n+- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limits and constraints\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.\\\\n+\\\\n+- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.\\\\n+- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.\\\\n+- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.\\\\n+- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.\\\\n+- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name (neutral branding).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a new theme\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

        "Response": "The changes introduce a new document, `how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps.md`, which details how to create and apply distinct branding themes to individual applications within an external Microsoft Entra tenant. This allows for unique sign-in experiences per application, overriding the default tenant-wide branding. The existing `how-to-customize-branding-customers.md` document has been updated to link to this new resource, and the table of contents (`toc.yml`) has been modified to include the new document under the \"Customize branding\" section for external identities.",

Each application can have its own theme that you can customize with a background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. This customization overrides any configurations made to the default branding. If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements are displayed.\\\\n+\\\\n+This article describes how you can create multiple branding themes for different applications in your tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+- Have at least the [Organizational Branding Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator) role.\\\\n+- Have at least the [Application Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role for applications that you want to apply a theme to.\\\\n+- A registered application in your tenant. If you haven't registered an application yet, see [Register an application](../../identity-platform/quickstart-register-app.md).\\\\n+- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Branding theme properties\\\\n+\\\\n+When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of the sign-in page, with each of the default branding elements highlighted.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps/sign-in-page-map.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+| Property | Description |\\\\n+| --- | --- |\\\\n+| Favicon | Small icon that appears on the left side of the browser tab. |\\\\n+| Header | Space across the top of the sign-in page, behind the header log. |\\\\n+| Header logo | Logo that appears in the upper-left corner of the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Background image | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Page background color | The entire space behind the sign-in box. |\\\\n+| Banner logo | Logo that appears at the top of the sign-in box |\\\\n+| Sign-in page title | Larger text that appears below the banner logo. |\\\\n+| Sign-in page description | Text to describe the sign-in page. |\\\\n+| Username hint and text | The text that appears before a user enters their information. |\\\\n+| Sign-in display message box | Text you can add below the username field. |\\\\n+| Footer link: Privacy & Cookies | Link you can add to the lower-right corner for privacy information. |\\\\n+| Footer: Terms of Use | Text in the lower-right corner of the page where you can add Terms of use information. |\\\\n+| Footer | Space across the bottom of the page for privacy and Terms of Use information. |\\\\n+| Template | The layout of the page and sign-in boxes. |\\\\n+\\\\n+## How branding themes work\\\\n+\\\\n+Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.\\\\n+- **Default branding (company branding)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.\\\\n+- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.\\\\n+\\\\n+- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.\\\\n+- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.\\\\n+- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Limits and constraints\\\\n+\\\\n+Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.\\\\n+\\\\n+- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.\\\\n+- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.\\\\n+- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.\\\\n+- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.\\\\n+- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name (neutral branding).\\\\n+\\\\n+## Create a new theme\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

        "Response": "A new document, `how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps.md`, has been added, detailing how to create and apply custom branding themes to individual applications within Microsoft External ID for external tenants. This new article introduces the concept of branding themes as a way to provide unique sign-in experiences for different applications, complementing the existing tenant-wide default branding.\n\nThe `how-to-customize-branding-customers.md` file has been updated to include a link to this new article in its \"Related content\" section. Additionally, the `toc.yml` file for the `external-id/customers` directory has been modified to include the new \"Branding themes\" section and link to the `how-to-customize-branding-themes-apps.md` article. Several image files related to the new branding themes documentation have also been added.",

There are many default attributes that you can use to trigger workflows, but sometimes you might require triggering a workflow based on a specific attribute not offered by default. Using custom attribute triggers, you can trigger a workflow to run for users based on when they move within your organization based on:\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Custom security attributes (CSA)](manage-workflow-custom-security-attribute.md)\\\\n+- Directory extension attributes\\\\n+- On-premises extension attributes (1-15)\\\\n+- EmployeeOrgData attributes\\\\n+\\\\n+## Prerequisites\\\\n+\\\\n+[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Entra ID Governance license](../includes/entra-entra-governance-license.md)]\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Use custom attribute triggers in a new workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center\\\\n+\\\\n+To use custom attribute triggers in a new workflow, do the following steps:\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Once Lifecycle Workflows starts checking for attribute changes, the time it takes for changes to be picked up might be delayed for these custom attributes. While changes should be picked up within minutes, there are upstream processes that will add further delays after the user attribute changes, for example:\\\\n+- Custom attributes might take up to 4 hours for their changes to be updated by the underlying service, however, once the custom attributes changes are propagated, Lifecycle Workflows should pick up the change within seconds.\\\\n+- Once changes are picked up by Lifecycle workflows, workflow execution will occur in the next target run, according to the schedule for users that meet the workflow scope.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Attribute vs custom attribute processing timing\\\\n+\\\\n+The following image shows the potential differences in processing times for using regular attributes and custom attributes in the workflow trigger. \\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/workflow-custom-triggers/custom-attribute-timing.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of a comparison between regular and custom attribute processing timing in a workflow run.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+In example A, The workflow is scheduled to run when the department attribute changes, it's 12:00 pm and the next target runs are at 1pm and 2pm:\\\\n+- At 12:10pm, the user department changes\\\\n+- At 12:15 pm, the user is detected to be in scope of the workflow\\\\n+- In the 1pm run, the user gets processed by the workflow\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+In example B, Workflow is scheduled to run when the TestCustomSecurityAttribute1 attribute changes, it's 12:00 pm and the next target runs are at 1pm and 2pm:\\\\n+- At 12:10pm the TestCustomSecurityAttribute1 attribute changes for a user\\\\n+- At 3:55 pm the change is passed to Lifecycle Workflows\\\\n+- At 4:00 pm the user is detected to be in scope of the workflow (too late for the 4pm run)\\\\n+- In the 5pm run, the user gets processed by the workflow\\\\n+\\\\n+For frequently asked question about using custom attribute triggers within lifecycle workflows, see: [Lifecycle workflows FAQs](workflows-faqs.md).\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Next step\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Lifecycle workflows execution conditions and scheduling](lifecycle-workflow-execution-conditions.md)\\\\n+- [Custom security attributes (CSA)](manage-workflow-custom-security-attribute.md)\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"0e5988f299227186b01c36ae34054bdf60cf157b\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/id-governance/workflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 17,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fid-governance%2Fworkflows-faqs.md?ref=03a276baeb24eb2d9a06dd6f0b031e40e4cc08ad\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -58,6 +58,23 @@ Lifecycle workflows checks that the user is assigned the custom security attribu\\\\n \\\\n If a user is assigned a custom security attribute that has multiple values, and one of the values matches the value in the specified in rule expressions, the user matches the scope.\\\\n \\\\n+### Why can’t I see the custom attributes listed in the attributes change trigger?\\\\n+\\\\n+To see the expected attributes in the drop down list, you need to ensure the following:\\\\n+\\\\n+- The attributes must be configured and active\\\\n+- For custom security attributes, you have the appropriate permissions\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+### Do workflows using custom attribute triggers always take 4 hours to process changes?\\\\n+\\\\n+No, the change processing time can vary depending on tenant change activity, timing and volume, with 4 hours expected to be the upper limit.

The compromised TAP can also serve as a reliable backdoor mechanism, allowing threat actors to maintain access even if other compromised credentials are detected and revoked, since the TAP appears as a legitimate administrative tool in security logs.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Remediation action**\\\\n+\\\\n+- [Configure Temporary Access Pass for one-time use in authentication methods policy](/entra/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass#enable-the-temporary-access-pass-policy) \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"2375f6d8983f4abf2988233777cffcda0751ac79\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/includes/secure-recommendations/21847.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21847.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21847.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21847.md?ref=5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.topic: include\\\\n ms.date: 08/19/2025\\\\n ms.custom: Identity-Secure-Recommendation\\\\n+# minimumlicense: P1\\\\n # sfipillar: Protect identities and secrets\\\\n # category: Credential management\\\\n # risklevel: High\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"518206ca8af9c210f5cad1ca05b50d3189741e33\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/includes/secure-recommendations/21848.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21848.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21848.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21848.md?ref=5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -6,6 +6,7 @@ ms.service: entra-id\\\\n ms.topic: include\\\\n ms.date: 10/09/2025\\\\n ms.custom: Identity-Secure-Recommendation\\\\n+# minimumlicense: P1\\\\n # sfipillar: Protect identities and secrets\\\\n # category: Credential management\\\\n # risklevel: Medium\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"be31378bbb0f8f35f0275df33c575a2cc42956e6\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/includes/secure-recommendations/21849.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 20,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 20,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21849.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21849.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fincludes%2Fsecure-recommendations%2F21849.md?ref=5c64f707f390579f5e1547cc1f5c41fc3315f358\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -0,0 +1,20 @@\\\\n+---\\\\n+title: Smart lockout duration is set to a minimum of 60 \\\\n+ms.author: joflore\\\\n+author: MicrosoftGuyJFlo\\\\n+ms.service: entra-id\\\\n+ms.topic: include\\\\n+ms.date: 10/27/2025\\\\n+ms.custom: Identity-Secure-Recommendation\\\\n+# minimumlicense: P1\\\\n+# sfipillar: Protect identities and secrets\\\\n+# category: Credential management\\\\n+# risklevel: Medium\\\\n+# userimpact: Low\\\\n+# implementationcost: Low\\\\n+---\\\\n+When Smart Lockout duration is configured below the default 60 seconds, threat actors can exploit shortened lockout periods to conduct password spray and credential stuffing attacks more effectively.

        "Response": "This commit addresses security configurations and recommendations within Microsoft Entra ID. It updates documentation to reflect license changes for various security checks, making many features available without specific premium licenses. Additionally, several new security recommendations and best practices have been introduced, focusing on areas like workload identity security, temporary access pass usage, and the blocking of legacy PowerShell modules. The changes also refine existing security recommendations related to service principals and entitlement management.",

This change is part of hardening all Microsoft products as part of the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative). As part of this initiative, we're eliminating the mechanism to export device registration keys from device storage after registration completes. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+This change means that users of Android devices will no longer be able to modify their browser access settings in Authenticator app or Company Portal after their device has been registered in Microsoft Entra ID. Instead, Android users have browser access enabled by default. \\\\n+\\\\n+## If you're an MDM provider\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+We request that you modify your [Android Device policy](https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies) resource to support enabling browser access during device registration. The policy resource is used to create and save groups of device and app management settings for your customers to apply to devices.\\\\n+\\\\n+To enable browser access on behalf of your customers, you need to either create or modify an existing policy to provide a delegated certificate to the Authenticator app and Company Portal. \\\\n+\\\\n+The following is an example of a policy: \\\\n+\\\\n+**Policy example for setting delegated scope CERT_INSTALL for authenticator**\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+```html\\\\n+\\\\\\\"applications\\\\\\\": [{\\\\n+    \\\\\\\"packageName\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"com.azure.authenticator\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    \\\\\\\"installType\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"REQUIRED_FOR_SETUP\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    \\\\\\\"delegatedScopes\\\\\\\": [\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"CERT_INSTALL\\\\\\\"\\\\n+      ]   \\\\n+}],\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+CERT_INSTALL - Grants access to certificate installation and management. - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#DELEGATION_CERT_INSTALL\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+More information can be found here: [Android MDM create and apply policy](https://microsoft.sharepoint-df.com/:w:/t/AzureADDevices/EUBvQT-nqK1GhgrNwoOsUbYBUfCGH0uZM7bLQBPS56bggw?e=UvUuF0).\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+If you fail to make the requested change, your end users encounter the following behavior: \\\\n+\\\\n+-\\\\tIf the device is registered in Microsoft Entra with Browser Access enabled\\\\n+    - No effect \\\\n+-\\\\tIf the device is registered in Microsoft Entra but Browser Access isn't enabled: \\\\n+    - Access to CA-protected resources on a non Microsoft Edge browser will be blocked.\\\\n+    - If the user requires access to CA-protected resources on a web browser, they'll have to use Microsoft Edge. \\\\n+-\\\\tIf the device is undergoing registration for the first time: \\\\n+    - The user is prompted to choose a certificate type and name their certificate as part of the registration flow. \\\\n+    - This certificate is used to enable browser access. \\\\n+    - Once this certificate is on the device, browser access is enabled, and the user can access CA-protected resources on any browser of their choice. \\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+:::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"media/browser-access-guidance-third-party-devices/device-certificates.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of setting device certificates.\\\\\\\" lightbox=\\\\\\\"media/browser-access-guidance-third-party-devices/device-certificates.png\\\\\\\":::\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+## Related content\\\\n+\\\\n+- [What's new in Microsoft Entra - September 2024](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/whats-new-in-microsoft-entra---september-2024/4253153)\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"500b1f0b5058441dd10c2edb5a0dd5217fe90c96\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/devices/media/browser-access-guidance-third-party-devices/device-certificates.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 0,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/6529906a3c8f9dddaf5000a4af5c737e4d9e1c82/docs%2Fidentity%2Fdevices%2Fmedia%2Fbrowser-access-guidance-third-party-devices%2Fdevice-certificates.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/6529906a3c8f9dddaf5000a4af5c737e4d9e1c82/docs%2Fidentity%2Fdevices%2Fmedia%2Fbrowser-access-guidance-third-party-devices%2Fdevice-certificates.png\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fdevices%2Fmedia%2Fbrowser-access-guidance-third-party-devices%2Fdevice-certificates.png?ref=6529906a3c8f9dddaf5000a4af5c737e4d9e1c82\\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"d0343fede79aef9e5454c217f4f8fb3557b71405\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/identity/enterprise-apps/disable-user-sign-in-portal.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 1,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/6529906a3c8f9dddaf5000a4af5c737e4d9e1c82/docs%2Fidentity%2Fenterprise-apps%2Fdisable-user-sign-in-portal.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/6529906a3c8f9dddaf5000a4af5c737e4d9e1c82/docs%2Fidentity%2Fenterprise-apps%2Fdisable-user-sign-in-portal.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Fidentity%2Fenterprise-apps%2Fdisable-user-sign-in-portal.md?ref=6529906a3c8f9dddaf5000a4af5c737e4d9e1c82\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -19,7 +19,7 @@ zone_pivot_groups: enterprise-apps-all\\\\n ---\\\\n # Disable user sign-in for an application\\\\n \\\\n-There might be situations while configuring or managing an application where you don't want tokens to be issued for an application.

However, the Workday ISU account always operates in the Pacific Time Zone (PT), causing delays in processing termination events for workers in time zones ahead of PT.\\\\n+\\\\n+For example, let's say a Workday user in **Melbourne (UTC+10, +17 hours ahead of PDT in May)** is terminated with an effective termination date of **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM Melbourne time**. Using the Workday ISU account, the Microsoft Entra Workday connector fetches the termination event in the provisioning cycle that runs after **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT**, which is **May 15, 2025, 4:59 PM Melbourne time**—a significant delay.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> We make public previews available to our customers under the terms applicable to previews. These terms are outlined in the overall Microsoft product terms for [online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).\\\\n+\\\\n+To mitigate this issue, the connector now includes a **24-hour termination lookahead query**. This query ensures termination-related attributes (`StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork`, `StatusTerminationDate`) appear in the connector feed when the termination day begins in PT. The exact processing time varies due to daylight saving time adjustments.\\\\n+\\\\n+Examples of when termination details start appearing in the feed:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Melbourne (UTC+10, PDT+17)** → May 14, 2025, **5:00 PM Melbourne time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Melbourne whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Melbourne time at 5:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 17-hour time difference between PDT and Melbourne time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **India (IST, UTC+5:30, PDT+13.5)** → May 14, 2025, **1:30 PM India time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in India whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting India time 1:30pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 13.5-hour time difference between PDT and Indian Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Japan (JST, UTC+9, PDT+16)** → May 14, 2025, **4:00 PM Japan time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Japan whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Japan time 4:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 16-hour time difference between PDT and Japan Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+This adjustment ensures the termination data is available earlier for workers in time zones ahead of Pacific Time. By updating attribute mapping rules in Microsoft Entra ID, you can then implement time-zone aware terminations.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Job configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user’s access to the resource. For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or Password + text message. The user accesses a resource protected by this policy. \\\\n+Users can register for authentication methods that they're enabled for. An administrator can also configure a user's device by using a method like certificate-based authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-During sign-in, all settings are checked to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods are required by the Conditional Access policy. To sign in, the method must be allowed, registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength. \\\\n+## How an authentication strength policy is evaluated during sign-in\\\\n \\\\n-## How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated \\\\n+A Conditional Access authentication strength policy defines which authentication methods a user can use. Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user's access to the resource.\\\\n \\\\n-In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, all conditions from all policies must be met. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions. For example, if two different authentication strength policies both require passkey (FIDO2), the user can use a FIDO2 security key to satisfy both policies. If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies. \\\\n+For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or a combination of password and text message. The user accesses a resource that this policy helps protect.\\\\n \\\\n-### How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info \\\\n+During sign-in, Microsoft Entra ID checks all settings to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods the Conditional Access policy requires. For a successful sign-in, the method must be allowed, be registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength.\\\\n \\\\n-For security info registration [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode), the authentication strength evaluation is treated differently – authentication strengths that target the user action of **Registering security info** are preferred over other authentication strength policies that target **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')**. All other grant controls (such as **Require device to be marked as compliant**) from other Conditional Access policies in scope for the sign-in will apply as usual.  \\\\n+## How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated\\\\n \\\\n-For example, let’s assume Contoso would like to require their users to always sign in with a multifactor authentication method and from a compliant device. Contoso also wants to allow new employees to register these MFA methods using a Temporary Access Pass (TAP). TAP can’t be used on any other resource. To achieve this goal, the admin can take the following steps: \\\\n+In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, the user must meet all conditions from all policies. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions.\\\\n \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **Bootstrap and recovery** that includes the Temporary Access Pass authentication combination, it can also include any of the MFA methods.  \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **MFA for sign-in** that includes all allowed MFA methods, without Temporary Access Pass.\\\\n-1. Create a Conditional Access policy that targets **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')** and requires **MFA for sign-in** authentication strength AND **Require compliant device** grant controls. \\\\n-1. Create a Conditional Access policy that targets the **Register security information** user action and requires the **Bootstrap and recovery** authentication strength. \\\\n+For example, if two authentication strength policies both require a passkey (FIDO2), the user can use a FIDO2 security key to satisfy both policies. If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies.\\\\n \\\\n-As a result, users on a compliant device would be able to use a Temporary Access Pass to register any MFA method, and then use the newly registered method to authenticate to other resources like Outlook. \\\\n+### How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info\\\\n \\\\n->[!NOTE] \\\\n->- If multiple Conditional Access policies target the **Register security information** user action, and they each apply an authentication strength, the user must satisfy all such authentication strengths to sign in. \\\\n+For [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode) in security info registration, the evaluation of authentication is treated differently.

Suppose you are using the built-in phishing-resistant MFA strength. A user can still type in their password, but they are required to sign in with a phishing-resistant method such as FIDO2 security key before they can continue.\\\\n+- **Effect of an authentication strength on authentication**: Conditional Access policies are evaluated only after the initial authentication. As a result, an authentication strength doesn't restrict a user's initial authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Require multifactor authentication and Require authentication strength can't be used together in the same Conditional Access policy** - These two Conditional Access grant controls can't be used together because the built-in authentication strength **Multifactor authentication** is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n+  Suppose you're using the built-in **Phishing-resistant MFA strength** authentication strength. A user can still enter a password but must sign in by using a phishing-resistant method, such as a FIDO2 security key, before they can continue.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication methods that aren't currently supported by authentication strength** - The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't included in the available combinations.\\\\n+- **Unsupported combination of grant controls**: You can't use the **Require multifactor authentication** and **Require authentication strength** grant controls together in the same Conditional Access policy. The reason is that the built-in **Multifactor authentication** authentication strength is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Windows Hello for Business** – If the user signed in with Windows Hello for Business as their primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. However, if the user signed in with another method like password as their primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, they aren't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, choose **Sign-in options**, and select a method required by the authentication strength.\\\\n+- **Unsupported authentication method**: The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't currently supported in the available combinations.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Windows Hello for Business**: If the user signs in with Windows Hello for Business as the primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. But if the user signs in with another method (like a password) as the primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, the user isn't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, select **Sign-in options**, and select a method that the authentication strength requires.\\\\n \\\\n ## Known issues\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency** - When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times. \\\\n+- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency**: When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times.\\\\n \\\\n-  For example, let's say a resource requires passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, and a 1-hour sign-in frequency. 24 hours ago, a user signed in with passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource. \\\\n+  For example, let's say a resource requires a passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, along with a 1-hour sign-in frequency.

Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n \\\\n ## FAQ\\\\n \\\\n-### Should I use authentication strength or the Authentication methods policy?\\\\n-Authentication strength is based on the Authentication methods policy. The Authentication methods policy helps to scope and configure authentication methods to be used across Microsoft Entra ID by specific users and groups. Authentication strength allows another restriction of methods for specific scenarios, such as sensitive resource access, user risk, location, and more.\\\\n-\\\\n-For example, the administrator of Contoso wants to allow their users to use Microsoft Authenticator with either push notifications or passwordless authentication mode. The administrator goes to the Microsoft Authenticator settings in the Authentication methods policy, scopes the policy for the relevant users, and sets the **Authentication mode** to **Any**. \\\\n+### Should I use an authentication strength or the policy for authentication methods?\\\\n \\\\n-Then for Contoso's most sensitive resource, the administrator wants to restrict the access to only passwordless authentication methods.

Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user’s access to the resource. For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or Password + text message. The user accesses a resource protected by this policy. \\\\n+Users can register for authentication methods that they're enabled for. An administrator can also configure a user's device by using a method like certificate-based authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-During sign-in, all settings are checked to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods are required by the Conditional Access policy. To sign in, the method must be allowed, registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength. \\\\n+## How an authentication strength policy is evaluated during sign-in\\\\n \\\\n-## How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated \\\\n+A Conditional Access authentication strength policy defines which authentication methods a user can use. Microsoft Entra ID checks the policy during sign-in to determine the user's access to the resource.\\\\n \\\\n-In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, all conditions from all policies must be met. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions. For example, if two different authentication strength policies both require passkey (FIDO2), the user can use a FIDO2 security key to satisfy both policies. If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies. \\\\n+For example, an administrator configures a Conditional Access policy with a custom authentication strength that requires a passkey (FIDO2 security key) or a combination of password and text message. The user accesses a resource that this policy helps protect.\\\\n \\\\n-### How multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info \\\\n+During sign-in, Microsoft Entra ID checks all settings to determine which methods are allowed, which methods are registered, and which methods the Conditional Access policy requires. For a successful sign-in, the method must be allowed, be registered by the user (either before or as part of the access request), and satisfy the authentication strength.\\\\n \\\\n-For security info registration [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode), the authentication strength evaluation is treated differently – authentication strengths that target the user action of **Registering security info** are preferred over other authentication strength policies that target **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')**. All other grant controls (such as **Require device to be marked as compliant**) from other Conditional Access policies in scope for the sign-in will apply as usual.  \\\\n+## How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated\\\\n \\\\n-For example, let’s assume Contoso would like to require their users to always sign in with a multifactor authentication method and from a compliant device. Contoso also wants to allow new employees to register these MFA methods using a Temporary Access Pass (TAP). TAP can’t be used on any other resource. To achieve this goal, the admin can take the following steps: \\\\n+In general, when multiple Conditional Access policies apply for a sign-in, the user must meet all conditions from all policies. In the same vein, when multiple Conditional Access authentication strength policies apply to the sign-in, the user must satisfy all of the authentication strength conditions.\\\\n \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **Bootstrap and recovery** that includes the Temporary Access Pass authentication combination, it can also include any of the MFA methods.  \\\\n-1. Create a custom authentication strength named **MFA for sign-in** that includes all allowed MFA methods, without Temporary Access Pass.\\\\n-1.

If the two authentication strength policies have different sets of methods, the user must use multiple methods to satisfy both policies.\\\\n \\\\n-As a result, users on a compliant device would be able to use a Temporary Access Pass to register any MFA method, and then use the newly registered method to authenticate to other resources like Outlook. \\\\n+### How multiple authentication strength policies are evaluated for registering security info\\\\n \\\\n->[!NOTE] \\\\n->- If multiple Conditional Access policies target the **Register security information** user action, and they each apply an authentication strength, the user must satisfy all such authentication strengths to sign in. \\\\n+For [Interrupt mode](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined#interrupt-mode) in security info registration, the evaluation of authentication is treated differently.

For more information, see [Create and manage custom Conditional Access authentication strengths](concept-authentication-strength-advanced-options.md).\\\\n \\\\n ## Limitations\\\\n \\\\n-- **Conditional Access policies are only evaluated after the initial authentication** - As a result, authentication strength doesn't restrict a user's initial authentication. Suppose you are using the built-in phishing-resistant MFA strength. A user can still type in their password, but they are required to sign in with a phishing-resistant method such as FIDO2 security key before they can continue.\\\\n+- **Effect of an authentication strength on authentication**: Conditional Access policies are evaluated only after the initial authentication. As a result, an authentication strength doesn't restrict a user's initial authentication.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Require multifactor authentication and Require authentication strength can't be used together in the same Conditional Access policy** - These two Conditional Access grant controls can't be used together because the built-in authentication strength **Multifactor authentication** is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n+  Suppose you're using the built-in **Phishing-resistant MFA strength** authentication strength. A user can still enter a password but must sign in by using a phishing-resistant method, such as a FIDO2 security key, before they can continue.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication methods that aren't currently supported by authentication strength** - The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't included in the available combinations.\\\\n+- **Unsupported combination of grant controls**: You can't use the **Require multifactor authentication** and **Require authentication strength** grant controls together in the same Conditional Access policy. The reason is that the built-in **Multifactor authentication** authentication strength is equivalent to the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control.\\\\n \\\\n-- **Windows Hello for Business** – If the user signed in with Windows Hello for Business as their primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. However, if the user signed in with another method like password as their primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, they aren't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, choose **Sign-in options**, and select a method required by the authentication strength.\\\\n+- **Unsupported authentication method**: The **Email one-time pass (Guest)** authentication method isn't currently supported in the available combinations.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Windows Hello for Business**: If the user signs in with Windows Hello for Business as the primary authentication method, it can be used to satisfy an authentication strength requirement that includes Windows Hello for Business. But if the user signs in with another method (like a password) as the primary authentication method, and the authentication strength requires Windows Hello for Business, the user isn't prompted to sign in with Windows Hello for Business. The user needs to restart the session, select **Sign-in options**, and select a method that the authentication strength requires.\\\\n \\\\n ## Known issues\\\\n \\\\n-- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency** - When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times. \\\\n+- **Authentication strength and sign-in frequency**: When a resource requires an authentication strength and a sign-in frequency, users can satisfy both requirements at two different times.\\\\n \\\\n-  For example, let's say a resource requires passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, and a 1-hour sign-in frequency. 24 hours ago, a user signed in with passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource. \\\\n+  For example, let's say a resource requires a passkey (FIDO2) for the authentication strength, along with a 1-hour sign-in frequency. A user signed in with a passkey (FIDO2) to access the resource 24 hours ago.\\\\n   \\\\n-  When the user unlocks their Windows device using Windows Hello for Business, they can access the resource again. Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n+  When the user unlocks their Windows device by using Windows Hello for Business, they can access the resource again. Yesterday's sign-in satisfies the authentication strength requirement, and today's device unlock satisfies the sign-in frequency requirement.\\\\n \\\\n ## FAQ\\\\n \\\\n-### Should I use authentication strength or the Authentication methods policy?\\\\n-Authentication strength is based on the Authentication methods policy. The Authentication methods policy helps to scope and configure authentication methods to be used across Microsoft Entra ID by specific users and groups. Authentication strength allows another restriction of methods for specific scenarios, such as sensitive resource access, user risk, location, and more.\\\\n-\\\\n-For example, the administrator of Contoso wants to allow their users to use Microsoft Authenticator with either push notifications or passwordless authentication mode. The administrator goes to the Microsoft Authenticator settings in the Authentication methods policy, scopes the policy for the relevant users, and sets the **Authentication mode** to **Any**. \\\\n+### Should I use an authentication strength or the policy for authentication methods?\\\\n \\\\n-Then for Contoso's most sensitive resource, the administrator wants to restrict the access to only passwordless authentication methods.

However, the Workday ISU account always operates in the Pacific Time Zone (PT), causing delays in processing termination events for workers in time zones ahead of PT.\\\\n+\\\\n+For example, let's say a Workday user in **Melbourne (UTC+10, +17 hours ahead of PDT in May)** is terminated with an effective termination date of **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM Melbourne time**. Using the Workday ISU account, the Microsoft Entra Workday connector fetches the termination event in the provisioning cycle that runs after **May 14, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT**, which is **May 15, 2025, 4:59 PM Melbourne time**—a significant delay.\\\\n+\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> We make public previews available to our customers under the terms applicable to previews. These terms are outlined in the overall Microsoft product terms for [online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).\\\\n+\\\\n+To mitigate this issue, the connector now includes a **24-hour termination lookahead query**. This query ensures termination-related attributes (`StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork`, `StatusTerminationDate`) appear in the connector feed when the termination day begins in PT. The exact processing time varies due to daylight saving time adjustments.\\\\n+\\\\n+Examples of when termination details start appearing in the feed:\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Melbourne (UTC+10, PDT+17)** → May 14, 2025, **5:00 PM Melbourne time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Melbourne whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Melbourne time at 5:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 17-hour time difference between PDT and Melbourne time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **India (IST, UTC+5:30, PDT+13.5)** → May 14, 2025, **1:30 PM India time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in India whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting India time 1:30pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 13.5-hour time difference between PDT and Indian Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+- **Japan (JST, UTC+9, PDT+16)** → May 14, 2025, **4:00 PM Japan time**\\\\n+\\\\n+For a user in Japan whose last working day is 14-May-2025, the connector starts including the attributes `StatusTerminationLastDayOfWork` and `StatusTerminationDate`, starting Japan time 4:00pm on 14-May-2025, which corresponds to the 16-hour time difference between PDT and Japan Standard time in May.\\\\n+\\\\n+This adjustment ensures the termination data is available earlier for workers in time zones ahead of Pacific Time. By updating attribute mapping rules in Microsoft Entra ID, you can then implement time-zone aware terminations.\\\\n+\\\\n+## Job configuration\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

The primary changes involve:\n\n*   **Date Update:** The `ms.date` metadata has been moved forward to October 22, 2025, from March 4, 2025.\n*   **Clarification on User Registration Data:** Additional text has been added to explain that while user registration data typically updates within 36 hours, a small number of users might experience delays, and in such cases, users should check back after another 24 hours.\n*   **Latency Note Refinement:** The note regarding data latency has been slightly rephrased for clarity, incorporating the same 36-hour and 24-hour recheck information as mentioned above.",

        "Response": "This commit updates several documentation files related to Microsoft Entra Connect and Cloud Sync.\n\nKey changes include:\n\n*   **Windows Server 2025 Support:** Both `how-to-prerequisites.md` for Cloud Sync and `how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md` for Entra Connect now explicitly state that Windows Server 2025 is *not* supported due to a known issue with a specific update (KB5065426). A registry workaround is provided for affected users, and official support is noted as planned for a future release.\n*   **Group Filtering in Entra Connect:** The documentation for configuring group claims in Entra Connect (`how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md`) now clarifies limitations for group filtering, stating that it only applies if a user belongs to 1,000 or fewer groups, otherwise an overage claim is sent. This information has also been integrated into the general service limits document (`entra-service-limits-include.md`).\n*   **Minor Tweaks:** Some minor formatting and wording adjustments have been made across the files.",

The last publish timestamp (**Effective Date** property) in the CRL is used to ensure the CRL is still valid. The CRL is periodically referenced to revoke access to certificates that are a part of the list.\\\\n+\\\\n+**Immediate revocation of sessions with Entra CBA**\\\\n+\\\\n+There are many scenarios that could require an administrator to immediately revoke all of the session tokens so all access for a user is revoked. Such scenarios include \\\\n+- compromised accounts\\\\n+- employee termination\\\\n+- Entra outage where cached credentials are used which does not include CRL validation\\\\n+- other insider threats.\\\\n+\\\\n+If a more instant revocation is required (for example, if a user loses a device), the authorization token of the user can be invalidated. To invalidate the authorization token, set the **StsRefreshTokensValidFrom** field for this particular user using Windows PowerShell. You must update the **StsRefreshTokensValidFrom** field for each user you want to revoke access for.\\\\n+\\\\n+To ensure that the revocation persists, you must set the **Effective Date** of the CRL to a date after the value set by **StsRefreshTokensValidFrom** and ensure the certificate in question is in the CRL.\\\\n+\\\\n+The following steps outline the process for updating and invalidating the authorization token by setting the **StsRefreshTokensValidFrom** field.\\\\n+\\\\n+\\\\n+```https\\\\n+# Authenticate to Microsoft Graph\\\\n+Connect-MgGraph -Scopes \\\\\\\"User.Read.All\\\\\\\"\\\\n+\\\\n+# Get the user\\\\n+$user = Get-MgUser -UserPrincipalName \\\\\\\"test@yourdomain.com\\\\\\\"\\\\n+\\\\n+# Get the StsRefreshTokensValidFrom property\\\\n+$user.StsRefreshTokensValidFrom\\\\n+```\\\\n+\\\\n+The date you set must be in the future.

The solution is natively integrated with Microsoft identity infrastructure, allowing for streamlined deployment and management. By implementing this approach, organizations can access detailed telemetry and actionable insights to monitor sign-up flows, fine-tune detection thresholds, and respond proactively to emerging threats, thereby maintaining the integrity of their user base.\\\\n+When a user initiates the sign-up process, it is critical to prevent automated bots and malicious actors from creating fraudulent accounts.

To address this, Entra External ID supports integration with third-party fraud detection providers such as HUMAN Security. This integration enables real-time analysis of sign-up attempts, leveraging HUMAN Security’s advanced detection algorithms to identify and block suspicious activity before account creation is completed. The solution is natively integrated with Microsoft identity infrastructure, allowing for streamlined deployment and management. By implementing this approach, organizations can access detailed telemetry and actionable insights to monitor sign-up flows, fine-tune detection thresholds, and respond proactively to emerging threats, thereby maintaining the integrity of their user base.\\\\n+When a user initiates the sign-up process, it is critical to prevent automated bots and malicious actors from creating fraudulent accounts.

Or perhaps you configured SAP ECC or other applications to rely on Windows Server via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Kerberos. In these situations, you provision users into Windows Server AD. These users are then synchronized into Microsoft Entra ID.\\\\n 1. **Design the Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology.** If you are using SuccessFactors and have Windows Server AD, then you will need to install the provisioning agent to provision users into those domains. The Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology depends on the number of cloud HR app tenants and Active Directory child domains that you plan to integrate. If you have multiple Active Directory domains, it depends on whether the Active Directory domains are contiguous or [disjoint](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/disjoint-namespace).

The integration supports a broad range of employee-related data, including:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Core identity attributes**, name, employee ID, employment status.\\\\n-- **Organizational data**, including cost center, business unit, and reporting structure.\\\\n-- **Personal data**, such as date of birth, nationality, and contact information.\\\\n-- **Communication and external identifiers**, such as email addresses and external system IDs.\\\\n-\\\\n-This scenario is achieved by reading from multiple SAP HCM infotypes (Example: 0000, 0001, 0002, 0006, 0105), which are logical groupings of related employee data. These are accessed through SAP function modules (FMs) or BAPIs that abstract the underlying table structures.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Key Aspects of SAP IDM Integration\\\\n-\\\\n-A notable architectural feature of SAP IDM is its use of a staging area—a conceptually distinct layer between the source system (SAP HCM) and the productive identity store. This staging area offers several advantages:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Data validation and transformation**: Data is reviewed, enriched, or transformed before being committed to the identity store.\\\\n-- **Workflow integration**: Approval workflows are triggered based on staged data, allowing for human-in-the-loop validation.\\\\n-- **Schema flexibility**: Changes in the SAP HCM schema are accommodated by adjusting mappings in the staging area without altering the identity store schema.\\\\n-\\\\n-The staging area is equivalent to a \\\\\\\"connector space\\\\\\\" — a buffer zone where data is inspected and controlled before it becomes authoritative. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Contrast with Microsoft Entra Provisioning Flow\\\\n-\\\\n-Currently, Microsoft Entra’s inbound provisioning flow doesn't include a native equivalent of this staging area. Data transformations and validations must be handled externally; typically in middleware (Example: Azure Logic Apps or PowerShell scripts) before invoking the Entra provisioning API.

The Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology depends on the number of cloud HR app tenants and Active Directory child domains that you plan to integrate.

The integration supports a broad range of employee-related data, including:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Core identity attributes**, name, employee ID, employment status.\\\\n-- **Organizational data**, including cost center, business unit, and reporting structure.\\\\n-- **Personal data**, such as date of birth, nationality, and contact information.\\\\n-- **Communication and external identifiers**, such as email addresses and external system IDs.\\\\n-\\\\n-This scenario is achieved by reading from multiple SAP HCM infotypes (Example: 0000, 0001, 0002, 0006, 0105), which are logical groupings of related employee data. These are accessed through SAP function modules (FMs) or BAPIs that abstract the underlying table structures.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Key Aspects of SAP IDM Integration\\\\n-\\\\n-A notable architectural feature of SAP IDM is its use of a staging area—a conceptually distinct layer between the source system (SAP HCM) and the productive identity store. This staging area offers several advantages:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Data validation and transformation**: Data is reviewed, enriched, or transformed before being committed to the identity store.\\\\n-- **Workflow integration**: Approval workflows are triggered based on staged data, allowing for human-in-the-loop validation.\\\\n-- **Schema flexibility**: Changes in the SAP HCM schema are accommodated by adjusting mappings in the staging area without altering the identity store schema.\\\\n-\\\\n-The staging area is equivalent to a \\\\\\\"connector space\\\\\\\" — a buffer zone where data is inspected and controlled before it becomes authoritative. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Contrast with Microsoft Entra Provisioning Flow\\\\n-\\\\n-Currently, Microsoft Entra’s inbound provisioning flow doesn't include a native equivalent of this staging area. Data transformations and validations must be handled externally; typically in middleware (Example: Azure Logic Apps or PowerShell scripts) before invoking the Entra provisioning API.

One important one is IssuerUri. This property is a URI that is used by Microsoft Entra ID to identify the domain that the token is associated with. The URI doesn’t need to resolve to anything but it must be a valid URI. By default, Microsoft Entra ID sets the URI to the value of the federation service identifier in your on-premises AD FS configuration.\\\\n+When a domain is federated with Microsoft Entra ID, several properties are set on the domain in Azure.

The federation service is an instance of AD FS that acts as the security token service.\\\\n \\\\n You can view the IssuerUri by using the PowerShell command `Get-EntraDomainFederationSettings -DomainName <your domain>`.\\\\n \\\\n-A problem arises when you add more than one top-level domain. For example, let's say you have set up federation between Microsoft Entra ID and your on-premises environment. For this document, the domain, bmcontoso.com is being used. Now a second, top-level domain, bmfabrikam.com has been added.\\\\n+A problem occurs when you add more than one top-level domain.

The reason is, Microsoft Entra ID has a constraint that doesn't allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain. \\\\n+When you attempt to federate the bmfabrikam.com domain, an error occurs. This occurs because Microsoft Entra ID doesn’t allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain. \\\\n \\\\n ### SupportMultipleDomain Parameter\\\\n-To work around this constraint, you need to add a different IssuerUri, which can be done by using the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter. This parameter is used with the following cmdlets:\\\\n \\\\n-* `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`\\\\n-* `Update-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`\\\\n+> [!NOTE]\\\\n+> SupportMultipleDomain parameter is no longer available and does not work with the following modules:\\\\n+> * `Microsoft.Graph`\\\\n+> * `Microsoft.Entra`\\\\n \\\\n-This parameter makes Microsoft Entra ID configure the IssuerUri so that it's based on the name of the domain. The IssuerUri will be unique across directories in Microsoft Entra ID. Using the parameter allows the PowerShell command to complete successfully.\\\\n+> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n+> To federate multiple domains, you might need to make changes one by one because the -SupportMultipleDomain parameter is no longer available.\\\\n \\\\n-`-SupportMultipleDomain` doesn't change the other endpoints, which are still configured to point to the federation service on adfs.bmcontoso.com.\\\\n+<a name='how-to-update-the-trust-between-ad-fs-and-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n \\\\n-`-SupportMultipleDomain` also ensures that the AD FS system includes the proper Issuer value in tokens issued for Microsoft Entra ID. This value is set by taking the domain portion of the user's UPN and using it as the domain in the IssuerUri, that is, `https://{upn suffix}/adfs/services/trust`.\\\\n+## How to update the trust between AD FS and Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n \\\\n-Thus during authentication to Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365, the IssuerUri element in the user’s token is used to locate the domain in Microsoft Entra ID. If a match can't be found, the authentication fails.\\\\n+If you've added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and changed the token signing certificate, you're one step away from updating your federation information in Entra ID. \\\\n \\\\n-For example, if a user’s UPN is bsimon@bmcontoso.com, the IssuerUri element in the token, AD FS issuer, is set to `http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`. This element matches the Microsoft Entra configuration, and authentication succeeds.\\\\n+Follow these steps to update your federation information in Entra ID:\\\\n \\\\n-The following customized claim rule implements this logic:\\\\n+1. Open a new PowerShell session and run the below commands to install the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module:\\\\n \\\\n-```\\\\n-c:[Type == \\\\\\\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN\\\\\\\"] => issue(Type = \\\\\\\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid\\\\\\\", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, \\\\\\\".+@(?<domain>.+)\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/\\\\\\\"));\\\\n-```\\\\n+   > [!NOTE] \\\\n+   > `-allowclobber` will override warning messages about installation conflicts and overwrite existing commands that have the same name as commands being installed by a module. Use this value if you already have installed Microsoft.Graph module:\\\\n+  \\\\n+1. * `Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Entra -allowClobber`\\\\n+   * `Import-Module -Name Microsoft.Entra.DirectoryManagement`\\\\n+   * `Connect-Entra -Scopes 'Domain.Read.All'`\\\\n+   * `Get-EntraFederationProperty -domainname domain.com`\\\\n \\\\n+    :::image type=\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\" source=\\\\\\\"./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/entra-fed-property.png\\\\\\\" alt-text=\\\\\\\"Screenshot of output of the Get-EntraFederationProperty cmdlet.\\\\\\\":::\\\\n \\\\n-> [!IMPORTANT]\\\\n-> In order to use the -SupportMultipleDomain switch when attempting to add new or convert already existing domains, your federated trust needs to have already been set up to support them.\\\\n->\\\\n->\\\\n \\\\n-<a name='how-to-update-the-trust-between-ad-fs-and-azure-ad'></a>\\\\n+Once you have copied the ID displayed in the second column from the output, run:\\\\n+* `Update-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainID domain.com -InternalDomainFederationId 0f6ftrte-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-19xxxxxxxx23'`\\\\n \\\\n-## How to update the trust between AD FS and Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n-If you didn't set up the federated trust between AD FS and your instance of Microsoft Entra ID, you may need to re-create this trust. The reason is, when it's originally set up without the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, the IssuerUri is set with the default value. In the screenshot below, you can see the IssuerUri is set to `https://adfs.bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`.\\\\n+Follow these steps to add the new top-level domain using PowerShell:\\\\n \\\\n-If you have successfully added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and then attempt to convert it using `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainName <your domain>`, you'll get an error.\\\\n+1. On a machine that has [Azure AD PowerShell module](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)) installed on it run the following PowerShell: `$cred=Get-Credential`.\\\\n+1. Enter the username and password of a hybrid identity administrator for the Microsoft Entra domain you're federating with.\\\\n+1. In PowerShell, enter `Connect-Entra -Scopes 'Domain.ReadWrite.All'`\\\\n+1. Enter all the values as the below example to add a new domain:\\\\n \\\\n-Use the steps below to add an additional top-level domain. If you have already added a domain, and didn't use the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, start with the steps for removing and updating your original domain. If you haven't added a top-level domain yet, you can start with the steps for adding a domain using PowerShell of Microsoft Entra Connect.\\\\n+  ```powershell\\\\n+    New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainId \\\\\\\"contoso.com\\\\\\\" -ActiveSigninUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/2005/usernamemixed\\\\\\\" -DisplayName \\\\\\\"Contoso\\\\\\\" -IssuerUri \\\\\\\" http://contoso.com/adfs/services/trust\\\\\\\" -MetadataExchangeUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/mex\\\\\\\" -PassiveSigninUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/\\\\\\\" -SignOutUri \\\\\\\" https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/\\\\\\\" -SigningCertificate <*Base64 Encoded Format cert*> -FederatedIdpMfaBehavior \\\\\\\"acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp\\\\\\\" -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol \\\\\\\"wsFed\\\\\\\"\\\\n+  ```\\\\n \\\\n-Use the following steps to remove the Microsoft Online trust and update your original domain.\\\\n+Follow these steps to add the new top-level domain using Microsoft Entra Connect:\\\\n \\\\n-1.

The IssuerUri for a user from corp.bmcontoso.com needs to be **`http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`**. However the standard rule implemented above for Microsoft Entra ID, generates a token with an issuer as **`http://corp.bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`**, which won't match the domain's required value and authentication fails.\\\\n+When you add a subdomain, because of the way Microsoft Entra ID handles domains, it inherits the settings of the parent.

The primary focus is on clarifying the process for managing multiple top-level domains and subdomains when federating, especially in light of the `SupportMultipleDomain` parameter being deprecated in newer PowerShell modules. The documentation has been revised to reflect the current PowerShell cmdlets and best practices for updating federation configurations and managing certificates. Additionally, an image has been added to illustrate the output of the `Get-EntraFederationProperty` cmdlet.",

Features like self-service password reset let users update or change their passwords using a web browser from any device. This feature is especially useful when the user has forgotten their password or their account is locked. Without waiting for a helpdesk or administrator to provide support, a user can unblock themselves and continue to work.\\\\n+Microsoft Entra ID helps protect users' identities and simplify their sign-in experience. Features like SSPR let users update or change their passwords by using a web browser from any device. This feature is especially useful when users forget their passwords or their accounts are locked. Without waiting for a helpdesk or administrator to provide support, users can unblock themselves and continue to work.\\\\n \\\\n-Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication lets users choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or mobile app notification. This ability reduces the requirement for a single, fixed form of secondary authentication like a hardware token. If the user doesn't currently have one form of additional authentication, they can choose a different method and continue to work.\\\\n+MFA lets users choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or a mobile app notification.

This ability reduces help-desk calls and loss of productivity when users can't sign in to their devices or applications.\\\\n \\\\n-Self-service password reset works in the following scenarios:\\\\n+SSPR works in the following scenarios:\\\\n \\\\n-* **Password change -** when a user knows their password but wants to change it to something new.\\\\n-* **Password reset -** when a user can't sign in, such as when they forgot password, and want to reset their password.\\\\n-* **Account unlock -** when a user can't sign in because their account is locked out and want to unlock their account.\\\\n+* **Password change**: When a user knows the password but wants to change it to something new.\\\\n+* **Password reset**: When a user can't sign in (for example, after forgetting the password) and wants to reset the password.\\\\n+* **Account unlock**: When a user can't sign in because the account is locked, and the user wants to unlock the account.\\\\n \\\\n-When a user updates or resets their password using self-service password reset, that password can also be written back to an on-premises Active Directory environment. Password writeback makes sure that a user can immediately use their updated credentials with on-premises devices and applications.\\\\n+When a user updates or resets a password by using SSPR, that password can also be written back to an on-premises Active Directory environment.

For example, the user is prompted to enter a code on a phone or to provide a fingerprint scan.\\\\n \\\\n-If you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, is it really the user signing in with the username and password, or is it an attacker? When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased as this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\\\\n+If you use only a password to authenticate a user, it leaves a nonsecure vector for attack.

An example of such a solution is a proxy that uses a certificate trust chain outside Apple system root certificates.\\\\n \\\\n ## Related content\\\\n \\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    \\\"sha\\\": \\\"cdf1573a0191491797dd5c7a3073ac39658c52b4\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"filename\\\": \\\"docs/fundamentals/copilot-entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"modified\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"additions\\\": 26,\\r\\n    \\\"deletions\\\": 2,\\r\\n    \\\"changes\\\": 28,\\r\\n    \\\"blob_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/ecca2938dca70fa763c53bb867428f3db75c2edd/docs%2Ffundamentals%2Fcopilot-entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"raw_url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/raw/ecca2938dca70fa763c53bb867428f3db75c2edd/docs%2Ffundamentals%2Fcopilot-entra-security-scenarios.md\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"contents_url\\\": \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/contents/docs%2Ffundamentals%2Fcopilot-entra-security-scenarios.md?ref=ecca2938dca70fa763c53bb867428f3db75c2edd\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"patch\\\": \\\"@@ -28,7 +28,7 @@ Security Copilot is a part of the Microsoft Entra admin center, and you can use\\\\n | Microsoft Entra ID | [Tenants](#tenants)<br>[Users](#users)<br>[Groups](#groups)<br>[Devices](#devices)<br>[Roles and administrators](#roles-and-administrators)<br>[Domain services](#domain-services)<br>[Conditional Access](#conditional-access)<br>[Authentication](#authentication)<br>[Sign in logs](#sign-in-logs)<br>[Audit logs](#audit-logs)<br>[Recommendations](#recommendations)<br>[Health monitoring alerts](#health-monitoring-alerts)<br>[Service Level Agreement](#service-level-agreement) |\\\\n | Microsoft Entra ID Protection | [Risky users](#risky-users)<br>[Application risk](#application-risk) |\\\\n | Microsoft Entra ID Governance | [Access reviews](#access-reviews)<br>[Entitlement management](#entitlement-management)<br>[Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](#privileged-identity-management-pim)<br>[Lifecycle workflows](#lifecycle-workflows) |\\\\n-| Microsoft Entra Internet Access<br>Microsoft Entra Private Access | [License Usage](#license-usage) |\\\\n+| Microsoft Entra Internet Access<br>Microsoft Entra Private Access | [License Usage](#license-usage)<br>[Global Secure Access](#global-secure-access) |\\\\n \\\\n ## Microsoft Entra ID\\\\n \\\\n@@ -438,7 +438,7 @@ Refer to the prompts and examples in [Manage employee lifecycle using Microsoft\\\\n \\\\n ## Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access\\\\n \\\\n-The following sections describe how to use Microsoft Security Copilot for scenarios and use cases within Global Secure Access.\\\\n+The following sections describe how to use Microsoft Security Copilot for scenarios and use cases within Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access.\\\\n \\\\n ### License Usage \\\\n \\\\n@@ -456,6 +456,30 @@ For more information, see:\\\\n \\\\n - [Microsoft Entra licensing](/entra/fundamentals/licensing)\\\\n \\\\n+### Global Secure Access\\\\n+\\\\n+Microsoft Security Copilot supports network traffic logs in Global Secure Access, making it easier to investigate and monitor network traffic usage and behavior. \\\\n+\\\\n+This enhancement provides an interactive method for analyzing network traffic logs, allowing users to obtain valuable insights without the need to write complex queries.

These recommendations are influenced by accepted industry standards like those developed by NIST, the configuration baselines we use internally at Microsoft, and our experiences with customers. The recommendations are organized by the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=2bad2df65a416adb0e5838355b3e6b95#SFI-pillars) pillars:\\\\n-\\\\n-- Protect identities and secrets\\\\n-- Protect tenants and isolate production systems\\\\n-- Protect networks\\\\n-- Protect engineering systems\\\\n-- Monitor and detect cyberthreats\\\\n-- Accelerate response and remediation\\\\n+In Microsoft Entra, we group our security recommendations into several main areas.

In our initial release of this guidance, we focus on traditional [workforce tenants](/entra/external-id/tenant-configurations#workforce-tenants).

        "Response": "This commit introduces a comprehensive restructuring of the Microsoft Entra security documentation. The core `configure-security.md` file has been significantly revised, moving from a pillar-based approach to a more organised grouping of security recommendations. This change is accompanied by the creation of six new markdown files, each dedicated to a specific Zero Trust security pillar (Protect identities and secrets, Protect tenants and isolate production systems, Protect networks, Protect engineering systems, Monitor and detect cyberthreats, and Accelerate response and remediation), providing detailed guidance within each area. Additionally, the table of contents for the fundamentals section has been updated to reflect these changes, and a redirection has been added for the 'What If' tool documentation. Some minor updates have also been made to the Conditional Access documentation, including date changes and clarifying wording.",

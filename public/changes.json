        "Response": "This commit updates several documentation files related to Microsoft Entra Connect and Cloud Sync.\n\nKey changes include:\n\n*   **Windows Server 2025 Support:** Both `how-to-prerequisites.md` for Cloud Sync and `how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md` for Entra Connect now explicitly state that Windows Server 2025 is *not* supported due to a known issue with a specific update (KB5065426). A registry workaround is provided for affected users, and official support is noted as planned for a future release.\n*   **Group Filtering in Entra Connect:** The documentation for configuring group claims in Entra Connect (`how-to-connect-fed-group-claims.md`) now clarifies limitations for group filtering, stating that it only applies if a user belongs to 1,000 or fewer groups, otherwise an overage claim is sent. This information has also been integrated into the general service limits document (`entra-service-limits-include.md`).\n*   **Minor Tweaks:** Some minor formatting and wording adjustments have been made across the files.",

The changes also remove an include statement and add more detailed explanations and examples.",

Check with your networking team to see if there are failed connectivity attempts from the connector IP.\\\\n-- **Failed to validate chain of certificate error**: This error appears in the connector advanced logging when the certificate chain for a Global Secure Access service certificate such as *.msappproxy.net fails to be validated. Often this occurs when there is a proxy server configured on MicrosoftEntraPrivateNetworkConnectorService.exe.config but there is not also a system proxy server configured. You can set the system proxy using netsh winhttp set proxy address:port.\\\\n-- **TLS inspection is configured**: TLS inspection is not supported on Private Network connector traffic.

Ensure the network devices allowing Internet access to your private network connector don't perform TLS inspection.\\\\n-- **Proxy server exists between connector and resource**: The connector requires line of sight connectivity to the resource and cannot function if there is a proxy server between the connector and the resource. To confirm, test connectivity from the connector to the resource you've defined in your Global Secure Access application, such as file share or RDP server, to ensure the connector can access the resource. If you cannot connect to the resource from the connector server, you will need to resolve the network connectivity issue between the connector and the resource which may include relocating the connector to a network location with line of sight access to the resource.\\\\n+- **Cloud Service connectivity failures**: Your connector might be having problems connecting to the Microsoft Entra Private Access cloud service.

To address this, Entra External ID supports integration with third-party fraud detection providers such as HUMAN Security.

This policy contains the HUMAN Security configuration values that you've received while setting up your HUMAN Security account.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the Microsoft Graph Explorer, select the **POST** method and enter the following URL:\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```http\\\\n+    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/riskPrevention/fraudProtectionProviders\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+2. In the **Request Body** section, enter the following JSON payload, replacing the placeholders with your HUMAN configuration values:\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```json\\\\n+    {\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"@odata.type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"#microsoft.graph.HUMANFraudProtectionProvider\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"displayName\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"<your-human-configuration-name>\\\\\\\",\\\\n+        \\\\\\\"appId\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"<your-human-appid>\\\\\\\",  \\\\n+        \\\\\\\"serverToken\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"<your-human-server-token>\\\\\\\",\\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+The `displayName` is a display name for this specific  HUMAN Security  configuration, for example, \\\\\\\"HUMAN Config 1\\\\\\\". The `appId` is the Application ID from HUMAN Security, and the `serverToken` is the Server token from HUMAN Security that you can find in the HUMAN Security admin console. If you're unsure about any value, contact HUMAN Security for assistance.\\\\n+\\\\n+3. Select **Run Query** to create the fraud protection provider.\\\\n+4. If the request is successful, a **201 Created** response is returned. Copy the `id` value from the response for the next step.\\\\n+\\\\n+### Step 3: Link HUMAN Security protection to your application\\\\n+\\\\n+In this step, you link the HUMAN Security fraud protection provider to your application by creating a new [authenticationEventListener](/graph/api/identitycontainer-post-authenticationeventlisteners) to use the HUMAN Security fraud protection during the sign-up flow. Make sure that you have the appId for the application where you want to enable fraud protection. Replace `<your-app-id>` with your application's ID, and replace `<id-from-previous-step>` with the HUMAN Security provider ID from the previous step.\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the Microsoft Graph Explorer, select the **POST** method and enter the following URL:\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```http\\\\n+    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/authenticationEventListeners\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1. In the **Request Body** section, enter the following JSON payload:\\\\n+\\\\n+    ```json\\\\n+    { \\\\n+      \\\\\\\"@odata.type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"#microsoft.graph.onFraudProtectionLoadStartListener\\\\\\\", \\\\n+      \\\\\\\"conditions\\\\\\\": { \\\\n+        \\\\\\\"applications\\\\\\\": { \\\\n+          \\\\\\\"includeApplications\\\\\\\": [ \\\\n+            { \\\\n+              \\\\\\\"appId\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"<your-app-id>\\\\\\\" \\\\n+            } \\\\n+          ] \\\\n+        } \\\\n+      }, \\\\n+      \\\\\\\"handler\\\\\\\": { \\\\n+        \\\\\\\"@odata.type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"#microsoft.graph.onFraudProtectionLoadStartExternalUsersAuthHandler\\\\\\\", \\\\n+        \\\\\\\"signUp\\\\\\\": { \\\\n+          \\\\\\\"@odata.type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"#microsoft.graph.fraudProtectionProviderConfiguration\\\\\\\", \\\\n+          \\\\\\\"fraudProtectionProvider\\\\\\\": { \\\\n+            \\\\\\\"@odata.type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"#microsoft.graph.HUMANFraudProtectionProvider\\\\\\\", \\\\n+            \\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"<id-from-previous-step>\\\\\\\" \\\\n+          } \\\\n+        } \\\\n+      } \\\\n+    }\\\\n+    ```\\\\n+\\\\n+1.

The Microsoft Entra Connect provisioning agent deployment topology depends on the number of cloud HR app tenants and Active Directory child domains that you plan to integrate. If you have multiple Active Directory domains, it depends on whether the Active Directory domains are contiguous or [disjoint](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/disjoint-namespace).

The integration supports a broad range of employee-related data, including:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Core identity attributes**, name, employee ID, employment status.\\\\n-- **Organizational data**, including cost center, business unit, and reporting structure.\\\\n-- **Personal data**, such as date of birth, nationality, and contact information.\\\\n-- **Communication and external identifiers**, such as email addresses and external system IDs.\\\\n-\\\\n-This scenario is achieved by reading from multiple SAP HCM infotypes (Example: 0000, 0001, 0002, 0006, 0105), which are logical groupings of related employee data. These are accessed through SAP function modules (FMs) or BAPIs that abstract the underlying table structures.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Key Aspects of SAP IDM Integration\\\\n-\\\\n-A notable architectural feature of SAP IDM is its use of a staging area—a conceptually distinct layer between the source system (SAP HCM) and the productive identity store. This staging area offers several advantages:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Data validation and transformation**: Data is reviewed, enriched, or transformed before being committed to the identity store.\\\\n-- **Workflow integration**: Approval workflows are triggered based on staged data, allowing for human-in-the-loop validation.\\\\n-- **Schema flexibility**: Changes in the SAP HCM schema are accommodated by adjusting mappings in the staging area without altering the identity store schema.\\\\n-\\\\n-The staging area is equivalent to a \\\\\\\"connector space\\\\\\\" — a buffer zone where data is inspected and controlled before it becomes authoritative. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Contrast with Microsoft Entra Provisioning Flow\\\\n-\\\\n-Currently, Microsoft Entra’s inbound provisioning flow doesn't include a native equivalent of this staging area. Data transformations and validations must be handled externally; typically in middleware (Example: Azure Logic Apps or PowerShell scripts) before invoking the Entra provisioning API. This architectural difference is incorporated in the following solution options.\\\\n-\\\\n ## SAP HCM and Entra Inbound Provisioning options\\\\n \\\\n This section describes options that SAP HCM customers can consider for implementing inbound provisioning from SAP HCM to Microsoft Entra / on-premises Active Directory. \\\\n@@ -140,7 +107,7 @@ This diagram illustrates the high-level data flow and configuration steps.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n ### Deployment variations\\\\n-If you don't have access to the SAP provided add-on integration module or don't plan to use SuccessFactors, even in this scenario, it’s still possible to use the CSV approach if your on-premises SAP ERP team can build a custom automation in SAP HCM to export CSV files regularly for both full sync and incremental sync. \\\\n+If you don't have access to the SAP provided add-on integration module or don't plan to use SuccessFactors, even in this scenario, it’s still possible to use the CSV approach as you can build a custom automation in SAP HCM to export CSV files regularly for both full sync and incremental sync.\\\\n \\\\n ## Option 2: SAP BAPI-based inbound provisioning\\\\n \\\\n@@ -152,7 +119,7 @@ This integration uses the [Azure Logic Apps SAP connector](/azure/logic-apps/con\\\\n - [SAP built-in connector](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap), which is available only for Standard workflows in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps.\\\\n - [SAP managed connector](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/sap) that's hosted and run in multitenant Azure.

The integration supports a broad range of employee-related data, including:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Core identity attributes**, name, employee ID, employment status.\\\\n-- **Organizational data**, including cost center, business unit, and reporting structure.\\\\n-- **Personal data**, such as date of birth, nationality, and contact information.\\\\n-- **Communication and external identifiers**, such as email addresses and external system IDs.\\\\n-\\\\n-This scenario is achieved by reading from multiple SAP HCM infotypes (Example: 0000, 0001, 0002, 0006, 0105), which are logical groupings of related employee data. These are accessed through SAP function modules (FMs) or BAPIs that abstract the underlying table structures.\\\\n-\\\\n-### Key Aspects of SAP IDM Integration\\\\n-\\\\n-A notable architectural feature of SAP IDM is its use of a staging area—a conceptually distinct layer between the source system (SAP HCM) and the productive identity store. This staging area offers several advantages:\\\\n-\\\\n-- **Data validation and transformation**: Data is reviewed, enriched, or transformed before being committed to the identity store.\\\\n-- **Workflow integration**: Approval workflows are triggered based on staged data, allowing for human-in-the-loop validation.\\\\n-- **Schema flexibility**: Changes in the SAP HCM schema are accommodated by adjusting mappings in the staging area without altering the identity store schema.\\\\n-\\\\n-The staging area is equivalent to a \\\\\\\"connector space\\\\\\\" — a buffer zone where data is inspected and controlled before it becomes authoritative. \\\\n-\\\\n-### Contrast with Microsoft Entra Provisioning Flow\\\\n-\\\\n-Currently, Microsoft Entra’s inbound provisioning flow doesn't include a native equivalent of this staging area. Data transformations and validations must be handled externally; typically in middleware (Example: Azure Logic Apps or PowerShell scripts) before invoking the Entra provisioning API. This architectural difference is incorporated in the following solution options.\\\\n-\\\\n ## SAP HCM and Entra Inbound Provisioning options\\\\n \\\\n This section describes options that SAP HCM customers can consider for implementing inbound provisioning from SAP HCM to Microsoft Entra / on-premises Active Directory. \\\\n@@ -140,7 +107,7 @@ This diagram illustrates the high-level data flow and configuration steps.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n ### Deployment variations\\\\n-If you don't have access to the SAP provided add-on integration module or don't plan to use SuccessFactors, even in this scenario, it’s still possible to use the CSV approach if your on-premises SAP ERP team can build a custom automation in SAP HCM to export CSV files regularly for both full sync and incremental sync. \\\\n+If you don't have access to the SAP provided add-on integration module or don't plan to use SuccessFactors, even in this scenario, it’s still possible to use the CSV approach as you can build a custom automation in SAP HCM to export CSV files regularly for both full sync and incremental sync.\\\\n \\\\n ## Option 2: SAP BAPI-based inbound provisioning\\\\n \\\\n@@ -152,7 +119,7 @@ This integration uses the [Azure Logic Apps SAP connector](/azure/logic-apps/con\\\\n - [SAP built-in connector](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap), which is available only for Standard workflows in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps.\\\\n - [SAP managed connector](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/sap) that's hosted and run in multitenant Azure.

Additionally, if the device is known to Microsoft Entra ID, the SSO plug-in passes the device certificate to satisfy the device-based Conditional Access check. \\\\n \\\\n-To support SSO for non-MSAL apps, the SSO plug-in implements a protocol similar to the Windows browser plug-in described in [What is a primary refresh token?](~/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md#browser-sso-using-prt). \\\\n+To support SSO for non-MSAL apps, the SSO plug-in implements a protocol similar to the Windows browser plug-in described in [What is a primary refresh token?](~/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md#how-is-a-prt-used). \\\\n \\\\n Compared to MSAL-based apps, the SSO plug-in acts more transparently for non-MSAL apps.
